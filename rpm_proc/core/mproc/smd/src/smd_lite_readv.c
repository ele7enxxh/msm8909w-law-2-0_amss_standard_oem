/** 
 * Reads data from the SMD port into the provided vector.
 *
 * Packet mode: This function will read the next packet in the port into the
 * provided buffer or buffers in the linked list of vectors \c iovec. Each
 * element of the I/O vector describes a buffer size and length, and a pointer
 * to the next buffer in the list. This function will copy as much of the
 * packet as possible into the first buffer in the chain, then continue
 * copying data until either the packet is complete or the buffers are
 * exhausted. If the packet is larger than the vector, as much data as
 * possible will be copied to the vector and remainder will be discarded.
 * Clients concerned about dropping data should call smdl_rx_peek() to
 * determine the size of the next packet.
 *
 * If the packet to be received is larger than the FIFO (specified when
 * opening the port using smdl_open()), and the #SMDL_READ_FLAG_LONG flag in
 * \c flags is not set, this function will read as much of the packet as is
 * possible in a single read, then discard the remainder of the packet. If the
 * #SMDL_READ_FLAG_LONG flag is set, this function will read as much data as
 * is available at a time, then return #SMDL_CONTINUE if more data must be
 * received before the read is complete. The caller is responsible for waiting
 * until it receives the #SMDL_EVENT_READ event callback, at which point the
 * caller must call smdl_readv() again, using the same arguments. This
 * function will read as much data as is possible, repeating as many times as
 * is necessary to read the entire packet, and ultimately return the size of
 * the entire packet when the entire packet has been read.
 *
 * Streaming mode: This function will read as much data as will fit into the
 * provided linked list of vector \c iovec from the port into the provided
 * buffer, limited by the value returned by smdl_rx_peek().  Any remaining
 * bytes in the port will be left there for future reads.
 *
 * Setting the #SMDL_READ_FLAG_LONG flag when a port has been opened in
 * streaming mode has no effect. This function will always read as much data
 * as is available and return the number of bytes read.
 *
 * This function does not block; it will return 0 immediately if no data is
 * available.
 *
 * This function may be called from the notification callback function
 * registered with smdl_open().
 *
 * @param[in]   port    The port to read data from
 * @param[out]  iovec   Pointer to a linked list of I/O vectors for the packet
 *                      to be copied into.
 * @param[in]   flags   Bitwise-or of flags controlling SMD's behavior. See
 *                      #SMDL_READ_FLAGS_NONE and #SMDL_READ_FLAG_LONG.
 *
 * @return       If data was read: The total number of bytes read into \c iovec
 * @return       If no data was available: 0
 * @return       If #SMDL_READ_FLAG_LONG is specified in packet mode and the
 *               whole packet was not read: #SMDL_CONTINUE
 * @return       If an error occurred: A negative error code.
 *
 * @sideeffects  Reads from shared memory and signals the remote processor.
