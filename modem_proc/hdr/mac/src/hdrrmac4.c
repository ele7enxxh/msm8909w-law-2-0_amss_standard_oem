GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This module contains the implementation of the HDR Reverse Traffic Channel
  Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol for an HDR access terminal.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  hdrrmac4_init
    Initialize the Reverse Traffic Channel MAC protocol.

  hdrrmac4_activate
    Activate the Reverse Traffic Channel MAC protocol.
    Power up RF Tx hardware.

  hdrrmac4_deactivate
    Deactivate the Reverse Traffic Channel MAC protocol.
    Turn PA off (if necessary), turn RF Tx off (if necessary).

  hdrrmac4_is_active
    Determine if protocol is active.

  hdrrmac4_start_tx
    Start TX after it has been stopped or after an activate command.
    If RF warmup is complete, turn PA on, start data.

  hdrrmac4_stop_tx
    Stop (suspend) transmission.
    Turn PA off, send HDRIND_RTCMAC_TX_STOPPED, stop asking for data.

  hdrrmac4_powerdown_tx
    Turns off RF TX hardware while RTC MAC is active.

  hdrrmac4_powerup_tx
    Turns on RF Tx hardware that was turned off with hdrrmac4_powerdown_tx().

  hdrrmac4_suspend_connection
    Suspends a connection -- no more data is requested for tranmission over
    the reverse link.

  hdrrmac4_resume_connection
    Resumes a connection that has been suspended. Turn PA, request data.

  hdrrmac4_shutdown
    Give HDRIND_RTCMAC_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE indication at the completion of
    the current frame, then cease data transmission (no more data is
    requested from PCP).

  hdrrmac4_process_cmd
    Process Forward Reverse Channel MAC commands from the task command queue.

  hdrrmac4_process_sig
    Process Forward Reverse Channel MAC signals received at task level.

  hdrrmac4_process_msg
    Process received Reverse Traffic Channel MAC messages.

  hdrrmac4_msg_cb
    Callback function that queues received Reverse Traffic Channel MAC
    messages onto the task message queue.


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The protocol must be initialized after system startup prior to activating
  the protocol.

  The Setup timer is used to abort the setup process if an acknowledgement
  is not received from the network within the required amount of time. 

  Note:  The Setup Timer is not implemented since there is a duplicate timer
         in the Route Update protocol that will *always* expire before this
         timer could expire.  Since the expiration of this upper layer timer
         causes this protocol's timer to reset, this timer is effictively
         not used.  The upper layer timer used is the T_RUPConnectionSetup
         timer in the Route Update State protocol's connection setup state.

FUNCTION     : HDRRMAC4_IS_APP_FLOW_BOUND_ALREADY                 LOCAL

DESCRIPTION  : 
  When AN GAUPs the AssociatedFlows attribute to redefine the MAC-RLP flow 
  mapping for a particular MAC flow, it doesn't explicitly unbinds those
  RLP flows if they were already bound to a different MAC flow. Having an 
  RLP flow bound to two different MAC flows at the same time is invalid. So
  AT needs to unbind the RLP flow from a MAC flow before binding it to a 
  new MAC flow as per AN's update. 

  This API is used to find out if a particular app_flow is bound to any 
  MAC flow other than the one given by 'bound_mf_id'. If a duplicate binding
  exists, the MAC flow ID and the AppFlow array index that has the duplicate 
  binding are stored into 'dup_mf_id' and 'dup_af_ind' respectively.

Note: This function is called from DS task.

DEPENDENCIES : None

PARAMETERS   :
  app_flow    - AppFlow being looked-up for duplicate mapping.
  bound_mf_id - MAC Flow bound to the AppFlow given by 'app_flow'.
  dup_mf_id   - If there is a duplicate binding, the MAC Flow ID which has
                the duplicate mapping is stored here.
  dup_af_ind  - This is used to store the index into the AppFlow array where
                duplicate binding is found.

RETURN VALUE : 
  TRUE if a duplicate binding is found.
  FALSE otherwise.

SIDE EFFECTS : None

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS
  combo_ptr - pointer to a single combo data structure used to interface with
              PCP.

RETURN VALUE
  pkt_built - TRUE if at least one of the assigned channels has a valid data
                   ptr from PCP.
              FALSE no packet is built for all the assigned channels

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION     : HDRRMAC4_GET_CHANGED_FLOW_MAPPING

DESCRIPTION  : 
  This function finds a set of App flows that are either bound or unbound from
  a particular MAC flow and stores it in the arrays bound_flows and 
  unbound_flows respectively.

Note: This function is called from DS task.

DEPENDENCIES : None

PARAMETERS   :
  unbound_flows - Array of Flow mapping structs with a set of App flows for 
                  each MAC flow that are unbound from this MAC flow due to 
                  recent GAUPing
  bound_flows   - Array of Flow mapping structs with a set of App flows for 
                  each MAC flow that are bound due to recent GAUPing

RETURN VALUE : None

SIDE EFFECTS : None
