GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  The Session Configuration Protocol (SCP) is the main state machine
  controlling the session layer of the HDR protocol stack.

                               subtype of a requested protocol
  hdrscp_get_config_subtype - Accessor function to get the negotiated
                              (InConfig) subtype of a requested protocol

                              a message for SCP
  hdrscp_process_sig()     - Function called by hdrmc task to process
                              a signal for SCP
  hdrscp_open_to_at_init_state - Function to perform processing for
                                 transition from Open to AT Init State

                            into Open State

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The Session Management Protocol must be initialized before any other
  1xEV-DO Protocols which have session-related data.

  result in a different desired subtype for any type, the interface will
  need to be expanded.

FUNCTION HDRSCP_CONFIG

DESCRIPTION
  Local helper function to manage the configuration process.

  Called with ConfigReason == HDRSCP_CR_AT_INITIATED when:

  * Idle state requests to change PCCC
    a) At time of request, if idle
    b) When ALMP returns to idle, if already configuring at time of request
    c) When AT acquires and gets overhead info

  Called with ConfigReason == HDRSCP_CR_AN_INITIATED when:
  * A ConfigStart message is received from the AN
    
  Called with ConfigReason == HDRSCP_CR_SUBSEQUENT_PERSONALITY when:
  * A SoftConfigComplete is received with continue = 1
    
  Called with ConfigReason == HDRSCP_CR_RETRY when:
  * AT initiated negotiation was interrupted due to poor RF conditions
    a) When ALMP returns to idle
    b) When AT acquires and gets overhead info
  * Connection setup fails during AT initiated state prior to AT sending
    ConfigComplete

DEPENDENCIES
  None

PARAMETERS
  config_reason - indicates whether the config was requested by an entity

FUNCTION HDRSCP_GET_CURRENT_SUBTYPE

DESCRIPTION
  This accessor function returns the current subtype of the requested protocol

  NOTE:- 
  In SCMDB when a particular personality is to be committed before pushing
  the negotiated data to SCP (and other protocols) SCMDB would loop through 
  hdrscmdb.inuse.scp.subtype and set all the protocols whose subtype is
  hardlink to that of the main personality's protocol subtype.

  So if in the current personality the protocol subtype is configured as 
  hardlink this function would return the subtype of the protocol in main 
  personality.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS
  protocol - Protocol type for which the subtype is returned

RETURN VALUE
  Subtype value of the requested protocol, 0xFFFF will be returned if invalid 
  protocol is requested. 

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION HDRSCP_PROCESS_OVHD_INFO_UPDATED

DESCRIPTION
  This function processes the OVHD.InfoUpdated Indication

  It is possible that we need to start or continue to configure the session

    us to continue, but we don't know for sure that we reacquired the same
    subnet until we get the overhead information and allow AMP to check this.
    Since AMP uses the OVHD.InfoUpdated Indication, SCP must wait for it as
    well.

  If the is_first_after_acq associated data is set to TRUE, this is the
    first InfoUpdated after the last network acquisition, so behave as if
    the INIT.NetworkAcquired Indication was received.

DEPENDENCIES
  SCP must process this indication after AMP.

  None.

FUNCTION HDRSCP_UNPACK_CONFIG_COMPLETE_MSG

DESCRIPTION
  This function first checks if the AN is allowed to send SCC/CC message 
  based on the negotiated personality count attribute, if this is correct
  then unpacks the config complete message fields into the structure
  passed in. After unpacking this function also validates the message
  based on transaction identifier.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS
  msg_id      - Message ID (Soft Config Complete or Config Complete)
  item_ptr    - pointer to the received message
  cc_msg_ptr  - Pointer to ConfigComplete message structure in which to unpack
                the fields of the message.

RETURN VALUE
  E_SUCCESS if the message unpacking was sucessful. Failure reason otherwise.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION HDRSCP_PROCESS_CONFIG_REQ_MSG

DESCRIPTION
  This function processes the Configuration Request Message and Attribute 
  Update Message

  One principle behind the design processing the Configuration Request Message
  is that we should always be able to respond.  If they give an attribute ID
  that we don't understand, we can still respond with default.  We may not
  know what the attribute is, but the network does and it's up to the network
  to interpret the default value of an attribute.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS
  item_ptr - pointer to the received message

RETURN VALUE
  None.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

  This function returns whether DORB is enabled in the NV item

  Please note that this function doesn't return whether DORB is negotiated. A
  return value of TRUE doesn't mean that DORB is negotiated. Despite AT's

DEPENDENCIES
  Assumes that the global variable force_at_config is already initialized.
  Must only be called after the NV item NV_HDRSCP_FORCE_AT_CONFIG_I has been
  read.

PARAMETERS
  TRUE - If AT is capable of DORB
  FALSE - Otherwise
