GENERAL DESCRIPTION
   The Overhead Messages Protocol monitors & processes the Control Channel
   QuickConfig & SectorParameters messages. The Protocol also monitors and
   processes AccessParameters messages which are re-routed to it by the
   Access Channel MAC.

    Callback registered with HMP to deliver messages

  hdrovhd_ind_cb()
    Callback registered for delivery of indications

  hdrovhd_activate()
    Command function to activate OVHD

  hdrovhd_deactivate()
    Command function to deactivate OVHD

  hdrovhd_get_acc_sig()
    Returns the value of the AccessSignature.

  hdrovhd_get_sp_msg()
    This function is used to access the current SectorParameters message.

  hdrovhd_get_ap_msg()
    This function is used to access the current AccessParameters message.

  hdrovhd_info_is_updated()
    This function is used to query if the Overhead Info has been updated.

  hdrovhd_get_link_id()
    This function is used to retrieve the link info of the current QC message.

  hdrovhd_get_sector_is_mc_capable()
    This function is used to query whether the current sector is MC capable.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS (Regional)
  hdrovhd_powerup_init()
    Function called to initialize OVHD on powerup.

  hdrovhd_init()
    Function called by hdrmc task to initialize OVHD upon entry into HDR.

  hdrovhd_process_cmd()
    Function called by hdrmc task to process a command for OVHD

  hdrovhd_process_ind()
    Function called by hdrmc task to process an indication for OVHD

  hdrovhd_process_msg()
    Function called by hdrmc task to process a message for OVHD
              
  hdrovhd_process_timer()
    Function called by hdrmc task to process a timer for OVHD

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The protocol must be initialized after system startup prior to activating
  the protocol.  The procotol must be activated before Control Channel
  Overhead messages can be processed.

FUNCTION HDROVHD_BC_INFO_UPDATED

DESCRIPTION
  This function pushes the most current BroadcastOverhead message information
  to the BCMAC and BCOVHD modules, then calls BCCP to update its flow table
  and determine if we are on the best BC frequency.

  This function is called when
  a) The current BroadcastOverhead message changes
  b) The QuickConfig message causes a change of the current cache entry (e.g. 
     idle handoff) and an up-to-date SectorParameters message is in the cache.
  c) A new SectorParameters message is received that causes an update to the
     cache.
  d) The set of requested flows changes.

  Note that if any of these events causes a channel change, then nothing is 
  done until after we change channels at which time one of these events will
  occur again.

PARAMETERS
  bc_entry_ptr - Pointer to updated BC info
  sp_msg_ptr   - Pointer to current SectorParameters message

  This function is called when a connection is shutdown. Thus, it processes
  ConnectionFailed & ConnectionClosed Indications. It resets the overhead info
  (that is makes it not updated). This is because while connected, overhead
  does not change it's channel according to the hashed value in the SP msg,
  whereas it needs to do so when AT is in Idle. Making the info not updated
  forces the next Sector Parameters to be processed, thus forcing the AT to
  hash to the correct channel.

FUNCTION HDROVHD_PROCESS_UNPACKED_QC_MSG

DESCRIPTION
  This function does the processing for the unpacked QC msg. It updates the
  cache if needed, updates the expected SP & AP msgs & the SP & AP info
  states. It also informs system determination if the QC msg received is the
  first one received after activation.

DEPENDENCIES
  Memory should have been allocated for the buffer into which QuickConfig msg
  is extracted.

PARAMETERS
  qc_info_ptr - Pointer to memory into which QuickConfig msg is stored.
  ind_to_give_ptr - Pointer to the structure containing information about
                which indication to give at the end of processing the msg.

RETURN VALUE
  TRUE  - If Access Terminal is allowed to continue on current HDR system
  FALSE - If AT has to change to another HDR system or exit HDR system

SIDE EFFECTS
  AT may have to leave current HDR system

FUNCTION HDROVHD_PROCESS_CACHE_ENTRY

DESCRIPTION
  This function does the processing required when a new entry is written into
  the cache. The processing involves:
  1. Informing System Determination of the Subnet if this is the first time
     after activation that overhead information has been received.
  2. Determine if tuning to a new channel is required.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

PARAMETERS
  cache_entry_ptr -  Pointer to the cache entry.
  ind_to_give_ptr - Pointer to the structure containing information about
                which indication to give at the end of processing the msg.

     this is the first time we are parsing a new SP message for this sector,
     the best bc hash channel is still set to the bc hash channel from the sector
     we just came from (bc ovhd updated won't be called until we are done 
     processing the SP message.)  

     Until bcovhd has updated its best bc channel, the bc override rules should

             If we know that the best bc channel is not up to date, the expected

             Before that, if the expected channel was set to an old bc hash 
             channel, the current SP entry would stay in WRITE_IN_PROG state 
             and the current cache entry in INVALID state.  This was still 
             considered a success because the assumption was that AT would 
             immediately tune to the bc hash channel when going through
             process_cache_entry (same thread). See (***)

                 Now that the best bc channel is updated, if we had decided to 
                 tune in unpack_sp_msg based on an old best bc channel, it is
                 possible that now we would decide not to tune and the current
                 cache entry would be in a bad (INVALID) state. 

                 We prevented this by ignoring the bc hash when unpacking the
                 SP message, but now we still want to ignore the bc hash based
                 on the updated best bc channel so we have to remember that
                 we were ignoring the bc hash when we unpacking SP.

                 The flag to ignore bc hash is unconditionally reset at the end 
                 of process_sp_msg to make sure that we can never get out of

FUNCTION HDROVHD_COMPUTE_HASHABLE_CHANNELS

DESCRIPTION
  This function computes and returns a list of hashable channels.

DEPENDENCIES
  The hashable_channel_list being passed by reference must be allocated
  HDR_SP_MAX_CHANNELS in size to accomodate the scenario where all possible 
  channels are included and hashable.

PARAMETERS
  sp_ptr                    - Pointer to the stored SP message.
  hashable_channel_list_ptr - Pointer to a list that will be updated with
                              the computed hashable channels.

RETURN VALUE
  The number of hashable channels.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION HDROVHD_UNPACK_SP_MSG

DESCRIPTION
  This function extracts & copies received Sector Parameters message to cache.

DEPENDENCIES

PARAMETERS
  item_ptr - A pointer to the DSM item chain holding the message.
  node_ptr - Pointer to the node to which to copy the received
                SectorParameters message to.

RETURN VALUE
  E_SUCCESS  - If extraction, unpacking of the message succeeds & field values 
             are valid.
  E_NOT_AVAILABLE - If the entry we want to extract the msg into is in use.
  E_NO_DATA  - If there was an error extracting the message.
  E_NOT_SUPPORTED - If band class of hash_channel is invalid.

SIDE EFFECTS
  If the extraction fails, then the cache node into which fields were being
  extracted is marked as INVALID since it does not contain proper values.

FUNCTION HDROVHD_COMPUTE_SP_HASH_CHANNEL

DESCRIPTION
  This function will process the SP message's channel and extended channel
  lists and remove any unsupported channels from the hashable channel list.
  After the removal of invalid channels this function will run the hashing
  function over the hashable channels and set the proper fields in the SP
  message pointed to by the sp_ptr parameter.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS
  sp_ptr - A pointer to the SectorParameters message
  current_link_ptr - Pointer to current link
  show_trace_output - If this flag is set to TRUE then the function will
    display a list of the hashable channels via F3 messages

RETURN VALUE
  E_SUCCESS if the channel is hashed; E_FAILURE in all other cases.

SIDE EFFECTS
  The SP message pointed to by the sp_ptr will have its hash_channel field
  updated to whichever channel has been chosen as the hash channel by this
  function.
