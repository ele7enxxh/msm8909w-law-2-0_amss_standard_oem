GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This module contains the Call Manager Call Object for WCDMA/GSM.

  The Call Object is responsible for:
  1. Processing clients' call commands.
  2. Processing Lower Layer replies for clients' call commands.
  3. Processing Lower Layer call related notifications.
  4. Notifying the client list of call events.


EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  cmcall_init
    Initializing the call object.

  cmcall_is_waiting_for_reply
    Check whether the call object is currently waiting for a reply.

  cmwcall_info_get
    Copy the current call state information into a specified buffer.

  cmwcall_client_cmd_proc
    Process clients' call commands.

  cmwcall_rpt_proc
    Process Lower Layer call commands.

  cmcall_timer_proc
    Process call timer events


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  cmcall_init() must be call to initialize this module before any other
  function declared in this module is being called.

02/01/05   dk      Added WLAN Support.
01/21/05   ka      end_status in call object is used to record the requestor
                   of call end for a data call (UE terminated or NW
                   terminated). LL_CAUSE refers to UE ending the call and

                   irrespective of whether error occured or not (client is
                   supposed to be always notified about command processing

06/09/03   AT      In multimode, the 1x version of cmcall_overall_call_state
                   changed the timing of when the overall call state changes
                   from IDLE to originating.  Made a change to reset the CCM
                   whenever we have a new call and are not in a CONVERSATION
                   instead of when we are in IDLE.  This allows the CCM to
                   reset to 0 before the first call, but removes the race

FUNCTION  cmwcall_call_cmd_ps_orig_state_check

DESCRIPTION
  This function checks if the state of the phone can support the origination
  of this PS call.  The checks made by this function include:

    1.  Check the SIM state to determine if it supports PS calls.
    2.  Checks if the maximum number of primary PDP contexts is not exceeded.
    3.  Checks if the profile number is not in use already,
    4.  Checks if the maximum number of secondary per primary PDP context
        is not exceeded.
    5.  Checks if the primary call ID/primary group id for the secondary
        PDP context activation is valid.
