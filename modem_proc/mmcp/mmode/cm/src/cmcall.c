GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This module contains the Call Manager Call Object for WCDMA/GSM.

  The Call Object is responsible for:
  1. Processing clients' call commands.
  2. Processing Lower Layer replies for clients' call commands.
  3. Processing Lower Layer call related notifications.
  4. Notifying the client list of call events.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  cmcall_init
    Initializing the call object.

  cmwcall_info_get
    Copy the current call state information into a specified buffer.

  cmcall_client_cmd_proc
    Process clients' call commands.

  cmcall_timer_proc
    Process call timer events


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  cmcall_init() must be call to initialize this module before any other
  function declared in this module is being called.

FUNCTION cmcall_perform_ssac_barring_check

DESCRIPTION
  Perform ssac barring check based on ssac params.
  I)  draw a new random number "rand1" that is uniformly distributed in the
      range 0 < rand1 < 1; and
  II) if the random number "rand1" is lower than BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video,
      then skip the rest of steps below and continue with session
      establishment as described in subclause 5.2;
  III) else, then;
  i)  draw a new random number "rand2" that is uniformly distributed in the
      range 0 < rand2 < 1; and
  ii) start back-off timer Tx with the timer value calculated using the
      formula:
      Tx = (0,7 + 0,6*rand2) * BarringTimeForMMTEL-Video; and
  iii) reject the multimedia telephony communication session establishment and

FUNCTION cmcall_voip_redial

DESCRIPTION
  Forces the appropriate SS for call origination to attempt VOIP

DEPENDENCIES
  Call object must have already been initialized with

  This function is expected to be called during the origination process
  before call is connected.

RETURN VALUE
  A ballpark estimation for the number of seconds the phone is going
  to be without service. If mode is not forced, return 0.

SIDE EFFECTS

FUNCTION cmcall_force_analog_on_the_fly

DESCRIPTION
  Force the mode preference to analog-only on the fly if necessary
  conditions apply.

DEPENDENCIES
  Call object must have already been initialized with
  cmcall_init().

  This function is expected to be called during the origination process
  before call is connected.

RETURN VALUE
  A ballpark estimation for the number of seconds the phone is going
  to be without service. If mode is not forced, return 0.

SIDE EFFECTS
  none

FUNCTION cmcall_remove_mode_and_force

DESCRIPTION
  Removes the given mode_pref from the call's favored_mode_pref and forces
  the appropriate SS for call origination.

DEPENDENCIES
  Call object must have already been initialized with
  cmcall_init().

  This function is expected to be called during the origination process
  before call is connected.

RETURN VALUE
  A ballpark estimation for the number of seconds the phone is going
  to be without service. If mode is not forced, the no servie timer is set to
  0.

  Return TRUE, the new mode preference is changed.
  Otherwise, return FALSE.

SIDE EFFECTS
  none
