GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This file makes up the System Selection Script (SS-Script) component of SD.

  An SS-Script is a sequence of SS-Script Constructs. Each SS-Script
  construct is a sequence of the construct name followed by predetermined
  number of parameters.

  An SS-Script shall only be parsed using an SS-Script-parser. The script
  parser provides an interface for parsing scripts and hides the details that
  are associated with the physical layout of the script.

  SS-Scripts are grouped into the following tables:

    User Events Script Table - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with user events.

    CDMA Acquisition Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with CDMA acquisition events.

    CDMA Operation Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with CDMA operation events.


    AMPS Acquisition Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with AMPS acquisition events.

    AMPS Operation Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with AMPS operation events.

    HDR User Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with HDR user events.

    HDR Acquisition Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with HDR acquisition events.

    HDR Operation Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with HDR operation events.

    GW Acquisition Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with GSM/WCDMA acquisition events.

    GW Operation Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with GSM/WCDMA operation events.

    WLAN User Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with WLAN user events.

    WLAN Acquisition Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with WLAN acquisition events.

    WLAN Operation Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with WLAN operation events.

    Miscellaneous Events
    Script Table             - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with miscellaneous events.

    Internal Events Script
    Table                    - This table enables associating unique scripts
                               with internal events.


    Called scripts table    - This table enables script to call for the
                              activation of other scripts.

  When the SS-Core receives an SS-Event it searches the appropriate script
  table to check whether a script is associated with SS-Event it received.
  The order of searching is from top of table to bottom. Searching stops once
  a match is found or when reaching the end of the script table. In the case
  where a match is found, the matched script becomes the active SS-Script.

MEAS( LIST, MEAS_MODE, MEAS_TYPE )

DEFINITION
  Get a channel strength measurement of mode MEAS_MODE and type MEAS_TYPE for
  all the systems that are referenced by the system record list LIST.

  MEAS_MODE can take on one of the following values:

    DED   - Dedicated mode measurement. The Searcher abort any protocol
            related activity and delicately work on completing the channel
            strength measurement report.

    BACK  - Background mode measurement. In this mode the Searcher
            multiplexes channel strength measurement with protocol activity
            in a way that is not intrusive to the protocol activity (similar
            to neighbor list searching). The background mode is
            available during CDMA/HDR idle and on GSM/UMTS when in Limited
            service.

  MEAS_TYPE can take on one of the following values:

    RXPWR  - Rx-power measurement.
    PILOT  - Pilot-strength measurement.
    NETLIST - Measurement based on network list.

SCOPE
  Only affects the channel strength measurement field of the actual system
  records that are stored in the system record table and referenced by LIST.
  (does not alter the LIST itself).

CONTROL
  Return control to the SS-Client, which then needs to submit the measurement
  request to Search. When Search comes back with the measurement report,
  the SS-Client should call on the SD_SS_IND_MISC_MEAS_RPRT SS-Indication
  function, at which time script execution continues with next script

DEFINITION
  Step through the system record list LIST (first to last) and try to acquire
  systems that are referenced by LIST and that were not already attempted
  acquisition since the last time the NEW_ACQ construct was encountered (and
  in accordance with ACQ_TYPE and the current SS-Preference).

  ACQ_TYPE can take on one of the following values:

    ANY: Try to fully acquire any system that complies with the current
    SS-Preference (without regard to PRL designation).

    ALLOWED: Try to fully acquire any system that is allowed by the PRL and
    complies with the current SS-Preference.

    PREFERRED: Try to fully acquire only a preferred PRL system that complies
    with the current SS-Preference.

    BEST_PREF: Try to fully acquire only a preferred PRL system that complies
    with the current SS-Preference in a two step process, as follows:

      1. Step through the system record list LIST (first to last) and
         try to acquire systems that are referenced by LIST.  Whenever a
         system from the PRL is acquired, continue with step 2.

      2. Try to acquire more preferred systems from the GEO of the system
         that was acquired in step 1 (most to last).

    MORE_PREF: Try to fully acquire only a system that is more preferred than
    the serving system and complies with the current SS-Preference.

    NOT_LESS_PREF: Try to fully acquire only a system that is not less
    preferred than the serving system and complies with the current
    SS-Preference.

    SPECIFIC: Try to fully acquire a specific system for which the SID/NID is
    known (for example systems that were included in a redirection message).

    SPECIFIC_PRL: Try to fully acquire a specific system for which the
    SID/NID is known (for example systems that were included in channel
    assignment message) and is allowed by the PRL.

    SPECIFIC_PREF: Try to fully acquire a specific system for which the
    SID/NID is known (for example a system that is included in a redirection)
    and complies with the current SS-Preference.

    COLLOC_PREF: Try to fully acquire a system that is associated
    (collocated) with the SDSR_IDL_SYS system and complies with the current
    SS-Preference

    COLLOC_MORE_PREF: Try to fully acquire a system that is associated
    (collocated) with the SDSR_IDL_SYS system and complies with the current
    SS-Preference and is more preferred than the serving system.

    COLLOC_BEST_PREF: Try to fully acquire only a preferred PRL system that
    is associated(collocated) with SDSR_IDL_SYS systme and complies with the
    current SS-Preference in a two step process, as follows:

      1. Step through the system record list LIST (first to last) and
         try to acquire systems that are referenced by LIST.  Whenever a
         system from the PRL is acquired, continue with step 2.

      2. Try to acquire more preferred systems from the GEO of the system
         that was acquired in step 1 (most to last).

    SAME_AS_LAST: Same as last acquisition attempt.

SCOPE
  Only affects the SS-Indication field of the actual system records that are
  stored in the system record table and referenced by LIST.  Does
  not alter the LIST itself.

CONTROL
  For each system that is referenced by LIST, control is returned to the
  SS-Client, which needs to try acquiring the selected system and then to
  come back with one of the following indications:

    CDMA: SS_IND_CDMA_ACQ_FAILED_PILOT, SS_IND_CDMA_ACQ_FAILED_SYNC or
    SS_IND_CDMA_ACQ_SCHM.

    AMPS: SS_IND_AMPS_ACQ_FAILED_CCH or SS_IND_AMPS_ACQ_CCH_SID.

  If no system in LIST is successfully fully acquired, script execution
  continues with the next script construct after the acquisition of the last
  system in LIST fails.

  If a system in LIST is fully acquired, script execution never goes past
  this construct - when receiving the SS_IND_XXX_OPR_OH_SID SS-Indication a
  reselection script shall take over control.

APPLICABLE

FUNCTION sdssscr_parser_is_contain

DESCRIPTION
  Check whether the script that is associated with the script parser that is
  pointed to by parser_ptr contains a specified script construct.

DEPENDENCIES
  The script-parser that is pointed to by parser_ptr parameter must have
  already been associated with a script via a call to sdssscr_parser_init().

RETURN VALUE
  TRUE if the script that is associated with the script parser that is
  pointed to by parser_ptr contains the specified script construct. FALSE
  otherwise.

   If rtrn_idx and rtrn_line are passed, the position of the construct is
  returned in those

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.
