FUNCTION MM_STATE_CONTROL

DESCRIPTION
  This function implements the state transition diagram of 2.4-s1.
  The diagram is encoded as a table of current state, event,
  next state, and action number. The function searches for the
  entry corresponding to the curent state and event, performs
  the action, and sets the state to be next_state.

  Note: This function may be reentered if any of the functions
        calls need to initiate a state change.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  None

SIDE EFFECTS
  None

FUNCTION MM_CHECK_RA_RETRY

DESCRIPTION
  This function deals with random access failure occurring during a
  location update procedure. The first time this happens, timer
  T3212 is started. When that matures, another LU attempt is made.
  If that attempt fails for the same reason, then the standard
  LU fail action is performed.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  None

SIDE EFFECTS
  None
