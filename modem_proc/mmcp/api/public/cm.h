/* CM command functions.

   The CM command functions define the Client->CM interface. Each command
   function takes a pointer to a client provided callback function, a
   client-provided void pointer, and the command's required set of fields.

   If the command function finds that one or more of the parameters contains
   invalid values (e.g., not one of the enum values for an enum parameter),
   it calls the client's callback function IMMEDIATELY with the appropriate
   command error code. In this case, the callback function is actually being
   called from the client context, NOT the CM.

   If all parameters are found to be valid, the command function queues a
   command to the CM. When the CM gets the command, it checks if the
   command is valid relative to the current state of the phone/call.

   If the command is not valid (e.g., trying to end a call that was already
   ended), the CM calls the client callback function with the appropriate
   command error code. In this case the, callback function is being called
   from the CM context.

   If the command is successful, the CM calls the client callback function
   with an error code that indicates a successful command. In addition, the CM
   notifies registered clients of the corresponding CM event (e.g., if a
   client successfully ends a call, the CM notifies clients that are registered
   for the call-end-event of this event). */

/** Type for call command callback functions. A client that wants to be
    notified of the results of a call command must supply a pointer to a
    function of this type as the first parameter to a call command function.

FUNCTION: cm_mm_call_cmd_orig

/**
  Commands the CM to originate a call. The client ID
  should be from a registered CM client.

  The activate_code field is only used for OTASP calls (i.e., the call type is
  CM_CALL_TYPE_STD_OTASP or CM_CALL_TYPE_NON_STD_OTASP). For non-OTASP calls,
  this field should be set to CM_OTASP_ACT_CODE_NONE. For called_number, if the
  number->digit_mode is set to CM_DIGIT_MODE_4BIT_DTMF, the number->buf may
  contain only the 0-9, #, or * characters, and if the number->digit_mode is set
  to CM_DIGIT_MODE_8BIT_ASCII, the number buffer may contain any 8-bit ASCII
  characters.

  If the call type is voice, the CM calls the application registered resolve
  call type callback function to determine if the dialed number is one of the
  special numbers for OTASP or Emergency. If it is a special number, the resolve
  call type function modifies the original call type accordingly. If no
  application registered a resolve call type callback function with the CM, the
  call type is not changed. For all call types, the CM calls the application
  registered call allowed callback function to determine if the dialed number is
  allowed. If no application registered a call-allowed callback function with
  the CM, the call origination for all dialed numbers is always allowed.

  For targets supporting dual slots, the application registered resolve call
  type and call-allowed callback functions are called as described above if
  there is no call control processing callback function registered. If there is
  a call control processing callback function registered, the CM calls the call
  control processing callback type function instead. This call control
  processing callback type function performs call type resolutions, call allowed
  checks, and any call control that is required. In the case of dual slots in
  automatic mode, conflicts may arise during call control. The CM calls an
  application-registered call control preferences callback type function to
  resolve any such conflicts.

  The client-supplied callback function cmd_cb_func will be called to
  notify the client of the command status. The error code is passed back to the
  client through the client-provided command callback function cmd_cb_func.
  If the command request is processed without errors, CM_CALL_CMD_ERR_NOERR
  is passed back to the client.

/*  CM command functions.

    The CM command functions define the client->CM interface.

    Each command function takes a pointer to a client-provided
    callback function, a client-provided void pointer, and the
    command's required set of fields.

    If the command function finds one or more of the parameters
    to contain invalid values (e.g., not one of the enum values
    for an enum parameter), it calls the client's callback
    function IMMEDIATELY with the appropriate command error
    code. In this case the callback function is actually being
    called from the client context, NOT the CM.

    If all parameters found to be valid, the command function
    queues a command to the CM. When the CM gets the command, it
    checks if the command is valid relative to the current
    state of the system.

    If the command is not valid, the CM calls the client
    callback function with the appropriate command error code.
    In this case, the callback function is being called from the
    CM context.

    If the command is successful, the CM calls the client
    callback function with an error code that indicates a
    successful command. In addition, the CM notifies registered
    clients of the corresponding CM event.
*/

/**
  Allows a client to register the following call-related
  callbacks and events with the CM:

  - Callback function to receive registered call events.
  - Register and deregister call events.
  - Callback function to receive other clients' call command
    errors.

   If a client registers a callback function to receive call event
   notification, it must also register one or more call events it is
   interested in receiving. This API has a cumulative effect for event
   registration. For example, in order to register for two different ranges
   of call events, a client must call this API twice; once
   for each range of call events.

   If a client registers a callback function to receive other
   clients' call command errors, it will receive notifications
   on all possible call command errors caused by other clients.
   A client cannot register to receive only a subset of call
   command errors.

   The NULL function pointer can also be used for the callback
   function if a client is not interested in receiving that
   callback. For example, if a client is not interested in
   receiving other clients' call command errors, it can set
   call_cmd_err_func = NULL. However, if the call_event_func is
   set to NULL, all registered call events are also
   deregistered, and the event_reg_type, from_call_event, and
   to_call_event parameters are ignored.

   it interested in receiving. This API has a cumulative effect for event
   registration.

@param[in] event_reg_type     Register or deregister.
@param[in] from_stats_event   Register from this event (inclusive).
@param[in] to_stats_event     Register to this event (inclusive).
