GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This file contains the lowest level state machine and the entrance
  and exit states for the CDMA Sub-system of the Main Control task.  It also
  contains all the global variables required by the CDMA sub-system.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  mcc_subtask
    The lowest level state machine for the CDMA Sub-system.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The Main Control task calls the mcc_subtask procedure after it has
  performed mobile system initialization and determined that the CDMA
  cellular system should be acquired.

                    This feature changes the MC<->SRCH interface for activating
                    and deactivating SRCH.  It moves the functionality in
                    cdma_rf_init(), to wait for the RF lock and tune the RF,
                   into SRCH. It moves TXC_CDMA_F into mccini, just before we
                   enter idle, since cdma_enter() now runs without the RF lock
                   and this command turns off the PA.

FUNCTION MCC_GET_NAM_INFO

DESCRIPTION
  This function loads the CDMA structure with the NV items associated with
  the given NAM.  Items are set to default values before the 1x subscription
  is available.  NV or RUIM access would only happen after 1x subscription
  is available.

DEPENDENCIES
  The value of cdma.esn needs to already be correct.

RETURN VALUE
  Whether or not the NAM information was read OK.  For FEATURE_OTASP, TRUE
  is always returned, since the NAM is allowed to be uninitialized.

SIDE EFFECTS
  If an item has never been written it is set to a default vaule.

  If (1x is out of service OR in UMTS mode)
  then the pilot counts (curr_plt_cnt, nbr_plt_cnt) filled up with zero value

  SVLTE mode and 1x mode are same

  This API returns the registered parameters required to cummunicate

  uplink and dowlink callbacks and event callback are of interest to the

  If there is no valid session context present this API will set NULL for 
  session context field of the returned value. It is the responsibility of 
  the caller to handle NULL session_context appropriately.

DEPENDENCIES
  For this API to return correct value:
    1. ASID for 1X should have already been set by CM

FUNCTION MCC_SET_ASID_SUBS_CAPABILITY_INFO

  This API will be called in MultiMode context to set ASID value and mask

  can also be derived from RAT mask.
  
  This API MUST be called whenever there is a change in ASID or

  called with updated values BEFORE sending the Protocol Activate 
  command as  part of re-activating CDMA.

  but it MUST be called before sending the Protocol Activate command
  to CDMA.
