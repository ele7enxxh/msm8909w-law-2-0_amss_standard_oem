GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This module contains the state machine for the CDMA Sub-system,
  Mobile Station Control on the Traffic Channel state. Conversations
  occur over a Traffic Channel in this state.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  cdma_tc
    The entrance procedure to the Mobile Station Control on the Traffic
    Channel state which determines which sub-state needs to be processed and
    vectors control to the appropriate procedure.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The mobile station must have received a Traffic Channel assignement
  message before entering this state.

  This function waits indefinitely for a strong pilot report from SRCH but

 If SRCH is stuck this could make MC also get stuck.
