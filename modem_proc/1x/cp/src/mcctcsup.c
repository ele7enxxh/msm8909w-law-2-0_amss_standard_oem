04/08/99   lcc     In tc_so_change, moved definition of con_init outside
                   FEATURE_DS.  It is used even FEATURE_DS is not defined.
04/06/99   ram     Removed the RXC calls to change the RXDSP clock
                   to 2/3 TCXO when an MDR call is up, and to
                   restore the RXDSP clock to CHIPX8 when calls end.
                   this is no longer needed because RXDSP clock is always
                   at 2/3 TCXO.
03/26/99   doj     Added logical negation to use_time parameter in call to
                   mccscm_duration_timer_chk to correspond to boolean sense
                   of implicit_start in prototype in mccscm.c.  Changed name
                   of mccscm_cancel_prev_dur_time to
                   mccscm_cancel_prev_dur_timer to agree with prototype in
                   mccscm.c
03/18/99   ck      Added support for Re-Authentication and processing of report
                   from DH task and removed the feature OTASP_800_HACK.
03/11/99   doj     In ghdm_valid_and_handoff_ok: changed reject_code to
                   mccscm_stat_enum_type; no longer rejects on FOR_SUP_CONFIG
                   or USE_FOR_DURATION when FEATURE_SPECIAL_MDR is defined.
                   In process_gen_ho_dir_msg: Added support for FOR_DURATION;
                   corrected use of sups_needed in generate_aset call -
                   sups_needed now indicates if we are to start using sup
                   chans; added call to generate_aset_default_sups for the
                   case when no forward supplemental info is included; added
                   scm_status for return value of mccscm_duration_timer_chk.
                   Added misc. comments.  None of the above have a CR number.
02/25/99   mdl     Removed extraneous mcc_rxc_cmd in tc_rxc_rpt in the RXC_VALID_R case
02/18/99   nmn     Updated use of service option report from SNM
02/16/99   nmn     Cleaned, linted, and tested SOCM support
02/13/99   doj     Added support for General Handoff Direction Message (GHDM).
                   Also includes several misc. updates by many people to
                   support FEATURE_SPECIAL_MDR.  Modified
                   process_ext_ho_dir_msg and process_ho_dir_msg to support
                   new active set format for MDR.
01/15/99   lcc     Merged following 6 items from MDR branch:
01/05/99   smp     Fixed bug in call to rlp_establish_srvc_type() - for MDR
                   service options, the RLP Type parameter should be set to
                   RLP_TYPE_II (not RLP_TYPE_I).
12/10/98   smp     Added support for the MDR RLP interface, under the feature

06/26/98   pms     mobile no longer drops call if it receives a SO message to
                   change rates while in WFO/WFA state.  Closes CR #5519
06/25/98   kis     Added support for ASCII digit mode during the origination
                   continuation message in send_orig_c_msg() function.
03/09/98   dna     Fixed TXC_TC_F to not set random signals when done.

11/04/96   rdh     Only printing PSMM msgs if using faked handoff parms.
09/19/96   rdh     Added centralized RXTX header loading fncts to save ROM.
09/13/96   dna     Re-merged changes from 1.6 which got lost in 1.7.
                   Allow process_tc_data_burst to return state (to power down)

  This function sends a command to the Authentication Task to perform a Base

DEPENDENCIES

RETURN VALUE

  The response is processed by tc_auth_rpt.  This is where the SSD update

FUNCTION TC_ACTION_CHK

DESCRIPTION
  This function checks the action time in a message.  If the action time
  is valid, it sets the action_timer to wake up on the action time and
  copies the received message to the tc_action_msg buffer.  If the action
  time is invalid, it sends a Mobile Station Reject Order to the base station
  indicating that the message was invalid.  If the function finds that the
  action timer is already set, this function will send a Mobile Station
  Reject Order since IS-95 only allows for one message with an outstanding
  action time.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  None

FUNCTION POPULATE_PIL_REC_INFO_IN_RTC_MSG

DESCRIPTION
  The pilot rec types that the MS/SRCH stores internally for each pilot is
  what the BS gave us but when we are reporting pilot rec types for the same pilots
  back to the BS in a Reverse Traffic Channel (RTC) message the BS is interested
  in only knowing if it is an aux pilot, they do not care about the TD info for
  these pilots as they "know" that already, This function dervives the info that
  needs to be sent back to the BS from the information we have
  stored i.e. in other words it maps pilot rec types referred by BS using table
  3.7.2.3.2.33-1 into table 2.7.2.3.34-1

DEPENDENCIES

RETURN VALUE

DESCRIPTION
  This function converts an action time in units of mod 64 super frame into

  of the retries by BS, the action time might have passed and if we calculate
  absolute action time using legacy abs action time API, then transaction might
  be delayed by upto 5.12s due to the action time rollover.
