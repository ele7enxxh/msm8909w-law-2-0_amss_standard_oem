FUNCTION MC_CMD

DESCRIPTION
  This is the outside world's interface to the main control task.
  This function takes a filled out mc_msg_type which it places
  on the mc command queue, it marks the request as busy in the status
  field, it signals the mc task and then it returns to the caller.
  Return to the caller does not mean that the command has been executed
  yet, only that it is queued for execution.  When mc is done processing
  the request it returns the buffer to the specified queue if a return
  queue adress is provided and it signals the calling task if specified.

  An example MC origination request is as follows:

  mc_msg_type  msg_buf;                       - Define message buffer
  byte         digits[MC_MAX_DIALED_DIGITS]   - Called address buffer

  msg_buf.hdr.cmd = MC_ORIGINATION_F;         - Origination request
  msg_buf.hdr.task_ptr = rex_self();          - Caller's TCB
  msg_buf.hdr.sigs =    _MC_SIG;              - Caller's end signal
  msg_buf.hdr.done_q_ptr = NULL;              - No buffer return

  msg_buf.msg.origination.cnt = sizeof(called_address);
  strncpy (msg_buf.msg.origination.called_address, digits, sizeof(digits));

  rex_clr_sigs (rex_self(), XXX_MC_SIG);      - Clear the signal
  mc_cmd (&msg_buf);                          - Issue the command

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

RETURN VALUE
  None directly.  The status variable of the mc_hdr_type will be updated
  to reflect the current status of this command as it is processed.  In the
  above example msg_buf.origination.hdr.status is set to:

  MC_DONE_S             - General OK return
  MC_BUSY_S             - Command is being processed
  MC_BADCMD_S           - Invalid command
  MC_BADPARM_S          - Bad Parameters

SIDE EFFECTS
  The msg_buf is placed on the MC command queue.  It must not be modified
  until the command has been processed and its status changed to MC_DONE_S.

FUNCTION MCC_SET_ASID_SUBS_CAPABILITY_INFO

DESCRIPTION
  This API will be called in MultiMode context to set ASID value and mask
  corresponding to the active RATs for the current subscription of CDMA.
  RAT Mask would be used to derive VSID and the VSTMR id that needs to
  be configured by 1X-L1. The subscription capability (Multimode or GSM) 
  can also be derived from RAT mask.
  
  This API MUST be called whenever there is a change in ASID or
  Subscription capability for CDMA. This change would be accompanied 
  by MMode deactivating and re-activating CDMA and this API must be  
  called with updated values BEFORE sending the Protocol Activate 
  command as  part of re-activating CDMA.
  During initial UE bootup this API should be called as early as possible
  but it MUST be called before sending the Protocol Activate command
  to CDMA.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

RETURN VALUE
  None.

SIDE EFFECTS
  This will update the ASID and Subscription Capability info for CDMA
