                     support for firmware PLT0441, which has a larger host
                     interface segment. Merged in KOVU support such that this
                     one file should support SINA or KOVU using T_KOVU to
                     indicate a KOVU platform.
09/25/01    mk/gw    Mainlined code under MONITOR_DEBUG. Cleaned up and added

05/24/01      jc     Added support for PLT0404, ie debug buffer is now
                     separate from host buffer. New debug struct. Size of
                     host segment increased ie SBI,NONSBI buffers increased.
