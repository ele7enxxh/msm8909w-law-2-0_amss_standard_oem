                       User Identity Module Low Level Driver

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

  This module contains the device driver for the UIM.  It handles the low
  level hardware interface to a UIM.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  uim_device_init()
  Turns on the clock regime, places the control lines in a low state and
  selects or enables the control lines.

  uim_power_up()
  Places the control lines in the proper state in the proper order so that
  the driver is ready to reset the UIM.

  uim_reset()
  Prepares the driver for a reset then resets the UIM.

  uim_send_pps()
  Sends a PPS request to the UIM then expects a PPS response.

  uim_update_op_params()
  Changes the baud rate on the I/O line based on a frequency conversion
  factor index and a baud rate adjustment factor index.

  uim_send_command()
  Causes an APDU to be sent to the UIM then waits for a response.  The driver
  may send a "GET RESPONSE" APDU to get the response and/or may send a "FETCH"
  to get a pro-active SIM command.

  uim_power_down()
  Places the control lines in a low state in the proper order for powering
  off the UIM.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

  uim_device_init() must be called prior to any of the other functions of
  this module.

                   overrun error without resetting the card.
06/12/03   ck      Added the check for UIM_UICC in addition to UIM_WCDMA to
                   arrive at the UIM instruction class.
06/03/03   ck      Changed the status from UIM_PROBLEM to UIM_CONVENTION_ERROR

03/10/03   djd     Added support for UIM2.
02/24/03   ts      Reset the UART receiver after stopping break.  This keeps
                   the receiver from detecting a character after releasing
                   the break condition.
02/19/03   ts      Fixed lint issues with kjm changes and UIM logging.
02/13/03   ck      Merged in the changes from kjm to improve the stability of

12/04/02   ts      Need the clocks to power down the UIM in the case the UIM
                   has already powered down or the clocks are turned off -
                   like when receiving a task stop.
11/26/02   ts      Moved tcxo frequency determination to uimdrv.h for use by
                   uimgen.c
                   Start with maximum frequency allowed when powering up.
11/21/02   ts      Give access to braf_values table for use in determining

10/04/02   ts      Commented the code that turned off the clock before turning
                   it back on.  This does not work with the cards.
10/02/02   ts      Added a new feature switch that disables converting the
                   transmitted byte to inverse convention.  This is needed to
                   work with SIM glue logic that changes both the transmit
                   and receive bytes with the SIM configuration control.
10/02/02   ts      Throw away retransmitted bytes received from the card.  This
                   is indicated by the parity error status.
10/02/02   ts      Changed MSM_INH to MSM_IN since the read is masked already by
                   MSM_IN.
09/20/02   ts      Reset the receiver when a receive overrun occurs.
09/20/02   ts      Use the last stop clock value to stop the clock when changing
                   the frequency.
09/20/02   ts      Turn off UIM clock and set clock select before turning UIM
                   clock back on.
                   Use shadow register when changing MISC_CTL_0.
                   Put time delays between turning off the UIM interface lines
                   when powering down.
09/16/02   ts      Added control to the stop bit length in the SIM configuration
                   register for the 6100.
09/12/02   ts      Removed enabling UART1_INT_ENABLE_UART_DP_RX_DATA_ENA for the
                   Cheetah. This conflicts with using GPIO55 and is not needed by
                   the UIM server.
08/07/02   wli     Added UIM UART clock regime control.
07/28/02   sb      Merged changes from rev1.22.1.2 by pmarsh & mainline CHEETAH_GSM.
05/28/02   plm     Added reference to T_UIM_NO_RX_WATERLEVEL to disable programming
                   of rx level for some targets when UIM_NO_SIM_GLUE_LOGIC undefined.
05/22/02   plm     Replaced references to T_KOVU, T_MSM5200 and T_MSM6200 with
                   T_UIM_USE_BSP_DEFINES, T_UIM_UART1_USIM_CFG, T_UIM_SIM_GLUE_LOGIC
                   and T_UIM_UART2_NON_SPLIT_MND_REGS target symbols to be defined
                   in targetXXX.h file for GSM and WCDMA.
07/18/02   wli     Put #include "log.h" back to this file. Removed diagbuf_init().
07/09/02   ts      Ported driver to MSM6100.
07/09/02   ck      Added the feature FEATURE_SLEEP_TASK to the featurization
                   around sleep.h
06/10/02   ts      Fixed the MND values to ensure a 50% duty cycle with the
                   UART clock.
05/21/02   ts      Added support for 256 bytes transfers from the UIM card.
05/09/02   ts      Needed to include 6200 in the definitions of the USIM
                   configuration register with 5200 and Kovu.
05/02/02   ts      Moved the UIM pad enable to the end of uim_dev_init.  Even
                   though the code uses MSM_OUT, it should use MSM_OUTSH.  The
                   rest of the code that accesses MISC_CTL_0 should also use
                   MSM_OUTSH and the shadow register needs to be defined.
04/03/02   AT      Added support for CHEETAH_GSM
03/18/02   ts      Moved the MSMU_OUT and MSMUW_OUT from uimdrv.h to this file
                   to avoid multi-definition problems with these macros.
02/06/02   ts      Programmed the clock source for the UART to be tcxo/4 for Leo.
                   Use a different feature switch to configure which clock source
                   the UIM UART uses.
02/29/02   ts      Changed the constant name in programming inverse convention
                   for Leo and PPG.  The constant (UART_SIM_CFG__SIM_CLK_OFF)
                   is used because it is defined for both targets.
02/08/02   ts      Added support for Leo (MSM6050).  Cleaned up the UART
                   configuration register access for SIM Glue logic chips.
02/07/02   wli     Added inverse convetion support for non sim glue logic targets.
01/25/02   ts      Added support for Kovu project.  Kovu is like 5200 with a few
                   changes.
01/23/02   ts      Added support to turn the UIM clock off at a high level and at
                   a low level through uim_update_op_params.
01/11/02   ts      Need to select UART2 as an alternate function when using GPIO
                   lines for UIM.
01/10/02   ts      Defined symbols to use proper GPIO lines for UIM power and UIM reset
                   control for Panther SURF.
12/20/01   ts      Set rx watermark level to 0 when sending bytes while processing
                   procedure bytes.  This keeps the driver from sending a tx
                   byte too soon after receiving a procedure byte.
12/13/01   ts      Fixed alignment of code and comments.
12/04/01   ts      Added support for UIM application toolkit and toolkit
                   download error.
10/26/01   ts      Stopped processing the NULL procedure byte.
10/18/01   ck      Added featurization around bsp header file as 3000 and 3100
                   targets do not use it.
10/10/01   ts      Changed the MSM5200 macro definition for accessing the UART
                   configuration register and the UART1 command register.  Also,
                   featurized (out) the watermaark level while waiting for transmitted
                   bytes for the MSM5200.  It causes the 5200 to lose a received
                   byte.
09/13/01   ts      Added support for inverse convention of UIM cards.  Featurized
                   under FEATURE_UIM_SUPPORT_INVERSE_CONVENTION.
08/10/01   ck      Removed  FEATURE that was prepended to UIM_NO_SIM_GLUE_LOGIC
                   as it is an internally defined feature.
07/27/01   ts      Consolidated the register and constant differences between
                   the targets.  Changed the UIM clock control to start with
                   tcxo/8 and switch to tcxo/4 if UIM supports higher
                   frequency.
07/26/01   wli     Added a time stamp for debug log.
06/26/01   ts      Updated the feature switches to have "FEATURE_" prepended.
                   Selected GPIO lines for reset and power control based on
                   SURF/FFA hardware feature switches.  Added 5200 driver
                   changes.  Changed clock control names and frequencies based
                   on tcxo relationship.
06/26/01   ts      Added checks for parity errors for targets that have SIM glue
                   logic to throw away received bytes with parity errors.
06/04/01   ts      Fixed the clock frequency value used to determine the
                   number of clock cycles for clk_busy_wait.
05/22/01   ck      Merged in support for logging the UIM transactions.
05/18/01   ck      Added support for USIM.
01/15/01   ck      Created file from R-UIM driver version 1.1.

FUNCTION UIM_CMD_RSP_TIMER_EXPIRY_CB

DESCRIPTION
  This procedure is registered as a call-back associated with the expiry of
  the command response timer. This call-back is called in the context of the
  high priority timer task as soon as the rex timer for the work waiting time
  expires.

  The logic in this call-back is as follows:
    - (for LCU) check if the count in the rx fifo + the packing buffer increased
        from the last check.
          - If the count increased, then re-start the wwt timer.
          - else, put driverís uim_rx_state to IDLE, mask all interrupts, reset
            uart, set cmd_rsp_timeout signal and powerdown the sim interface

    - (for non-LCU) check if RXRDY bit is set in the status. If set,
        set cmd_rsp_timeout and return. If not set, put driverís uim-rx-state to
        idle, mask all interrupts, reset uart, set cmd_rsp_timeout signal and
        power down the sim interface.

  NOTE: The powerdown sequence of the UIM (as in the uim_power_down() function)
        is not started within this call-back as it is a huge-piece of logic
        which might hog the CPU as this call-back is being executed in the
        context of the timer task. Hence, this call-back only signals the
        UIM task to initiate the powerdown sequence, if needed.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  None

SIDE EFFECTS
  Power down of the SIM interface if the command response timeout expired.
