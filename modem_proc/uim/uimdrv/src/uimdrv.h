/* Speed enhancement logic for LCU doesn't aim at reducing the etu (elementary
   time unit) value as it is depends frequency applied to card and the baud-rate
   negotiated with the card.

   Speed enhancement logic for LCU is based on programming a proper stale
   timeout value and rx water mark levels. RX water mark level is to receive
   and process the data as fast as possible. Stale timeout is to determine the
   end of data transfer. For a high stale timeout value, we wait un-necessarily
   for that much *extra* time if our expected size of data has already been
   received but just lying in the RX FIFO and packing buffer of the UART.
   So, to enhance the speed, we need to program lesser values of stale timeout
   and RX water mark levels. We are only trying to not let the race conditions
   or timing issues happen by not programming very low values of stale timeout
   and RX water mark levels. The UART HW designers recommended not to use very
   low RX STALE timeout values. The below stale and rx water mark levels were
   determined only by experimentation. */

  UIM clock.

DEPENDENCIES
  This function must be executed either after uim_dex_init or after

DEPENDENCIES

SIDE EFFECTS
  The UIM driver will continue to send out the APDU.  All the stages of

FUNCTION UIM_CMD_RSP_TIMER_EXPIRY_CB

DESCRIPTION
  This procedure is registered as a call-back associated with the expiry of
  the command response timer. This call-back is called in the context of the
  high priority timer task as soon as the rex timer for the work waiting time
  expires.

  The logic in this call-back is as follows:
    - (for LCU) check if the count in the rx fifo + the packing buffer increased
        from the last check.
          - If the count increased, then re-start the wwt timer.
          - else, put drivers uim_rx_state to IDLE, mask all interrupts, reset
            uart, set cmd_rsp_timeout signal and powerdown the sim interface

    - (for non-LCU) check if RXRDY bit is set in the status. If set,
        set cmd_rsp_timeout and return. If not set, put drivers uim-rx-state to
        idle, mask all interrupts, reset uart, set cmd_rsp_timeout signal and
        power down the sim interface.

  NOTE: The powerdown sequence of the UIM (as in the uim_power_down() function)
        is not started within this call-back as it is a huge-piece of logic
        which might hog the CPU as this call-back is being executed in the
        context of the timer task. Hence, this call-back only signals the
        UIM task to initiate the powerdown sequence, if needed.

  None

RETURN VALUE
  None

  Power down of the SIM interface if the command response timeout expired.
