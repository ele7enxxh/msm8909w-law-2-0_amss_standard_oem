                          MMGSDI CRITICAL SECTIONS
================================================================================
--------------------------------------
1. MMGSDI Critical Section Hierarchy
--------------------------------------
MMGSDI uses multiple Critical Sections and hence Deadlocks are a likely
scenario.
To avoid this, it has to be ensured that whenever MMGSDI acquires
multiple critical sections, it is done in the same order.
To help achieve this a MMGSDI locking hierarchy has been created
by assigning levels to MMGSDI critical sections.

Rules to be followed:
a. When MMGSDI is holding a critical section at level n, it cannot take
   a critical section at a level lower than n.
   (Ex: When holding a Level 2 critical section, a Level 1
    critical section cannot be acquired)
b. When MMGSDI is holding a mutex at level n, it cannot take
   another critical section at level n.
   What this implies is that if 2 critical sections are at the same level,
   they are assumed to be mutually exclusive to each other.If this is
   not the case, the mutex level of these critical sections needs to be
   adjusted by bumping up/bringing down their level as appropriate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CRIT.       |                    CRITICAL SECTION NAME
SECT. LEVEL |

     mmgsdi_gen_get_rsp_table_add()      - Cache the APDU Get Response
     mmgsdi_gen_get_rsp_table_flush()    - Remove all APDU Get Responses

DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to remove the in-progress requests from the global

  If command is cancel req - all requests with the client id is removed,

  The in-progess requests are removed in 2 steps:
  1. The matching in-progress requests are marked for no response & an error

  2. When the response from UIMDRV comes back, the corresponing entry is
     removed from the client request table

FUNCTION MMGSDI_PROCESS_RESPONSE

DESCRIPTION
  This function, called in gsdimain, is called to process an mmgsdi response.
  It will determine which card technology the command requires (UICC or ICC),
  determine the response type, and call the appropriate response processing
  function.

DEPENDENCIES
  gsdimain must be finished initialization.

LIMITATIONS
  NONE

RETURN VALUE
  mmgsdi_return_enum_type
  MMGSDI_SUCCESS          - Command processed,
  MMGSDI_INCORRECT_PARAMS - Wrong input parameters provided to function
  MMGSDI_ERROR            - Other unknown failure

SIDE EFFECTS
  NONE

   FUNCTION:      MMGSDI_CMD_EXT

   DESCRIPTION:
     This function allows client to put command into the MMGSDI command queue
     specific to a MMGSDI task

   DEPENDENCIES:
     None

   LIMITATIONS:
     Parameter check for specific commands are not performed

   RETURN VALUE:
     mmgsdi_return_enum_type

     MMGSDI_SUCCESS:          The command structure was properly generated
                              and queued onto the MMGSDI Command Queue.
     MMGSDI_CMD_QUEUE_FULL:   The command was not Queued to the MMGSDI Task
                              because the max number of commands are already
                              queued.

   SIDE EFFECTS:
     None
