   STRUCT:      MMGSDI_APDU_DATA_GET_RSP_CACHE

   DESCRIPTION:
     This cache will maintain the "Get Response" Buffer which is normally
     done by our UIM Drivers to ensure we don't lose the Get Response Data
     and at the same time still maintain an Active representation of the
     APDU Exchange Protocol as defined in 7816-3.

   USAGE:
     This cache is only active for a Client when sending APDUs. If the client
     sends an APDU Command resulting in a GET RESPONSE, i.e. intermediate Status
     Words: 61XX/9FXX, the GET Response data is stored.
     The client must issue a Get Response APDU as the subsequent APDU to retrieve
     the data stored.  If the subsequent APDU from the client on the logical
     channel is not a GET Response APDU, the current cache will be cleared.
