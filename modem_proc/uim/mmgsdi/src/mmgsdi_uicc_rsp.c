   FUNCTION:      MMGSDI_UICC_RSP_PARSE_UIM_RESPONSE

   DESCRIPTION:
     This function will parse write access to any file using the UICC protocol

   DEPENDENCIES:


   LIMITATIONS:
     For UICC protocol access, mmgsdi_uicc_write should be used

   RETURN VALUE:
     mmgsdi_return_enum_type

     MMGSDI_SUCCESS:          The command structure was properly generated
                              and queued onto the MMGSDI Command Queue.
     MMGSDI_INCORRECT_PARAMS: The parameters supplied to the API are not
                              within appropriate ranges.

   SIDE EFFECTS:
