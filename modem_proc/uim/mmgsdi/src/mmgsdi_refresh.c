  response_cb_ptr:  Callback to this command
  client_ref:       User Data returned upon completion of this cmd.

DEPENDENCIES

  FUNCTION MMGSDI_REFRESH_REMOVE_DUPLICATE_PATHS

  DESCRIPTION
    This function checks for duplicates in the both the files lists passed.
    the final concatenated list is updated in the client specific files
    pointer passed. This should affect only clients who have registered
    using both the reg-all & by-path options. Duplicate can mainly arise
    because of way files are associated to each session type in case of
    reg-all clients.

  DEPENDENCIES
    None

  LIMITATIONS
    NONE

  RETURN VALUE
    Builds a success/failure response to the caller

  SIDE EFFECTS

  FUNCTION:      MMGSDI_IS_FILE_IN_REFRESH_DATA_INFO_LIST

    This function is a utility to find out if a file is present in the
    global mmgsdi_refresh_data_info (that contains the files that have
    been requested to be refreshed as part of FCN or INIT_FCN refresh types).
    The idea is that if the file is present in the global for FCN or INIT_FCN
    refresh modes, the WRITE on that file will be blocked.
    As a special case, if the refresh currently underway is INIT_FFCN, the
    function returns TRUE regardless of the EF. This will ensure that when a
    INIT_FFCN is in progress, WRITE to ALL EFs is blocked for that app.

  FUNCTION: MMGSDI_REFRESH_RESET_CARD

  DESCRIPTION:
    This function will check to see if refresh was issued for Channel 0 of the card.
    If it was then it will create the linked list with nodes of all clients that
    have voted for init on any session so that all of them can determine if
    it is a good time to do a reset.

  DEPENDENCIES:
    None

  LIMITATIONS:
    None

  RETURN VALUE:

    MMGSDI_SUCCESS:          It is default app and the linked list has been
                             created.
    MMGSDI_ERROR:            It is not the default app.

  SIDE EFFECTS:
    All clients regardless of the aid in the refresh command will be asked if
    it is ok to init.

  FUNCTION: MMGSDI_REFRESH_PROCESS_RESET

  DESCRIPTION:
    A Refresh Reset Command has been received
       * Build Request based on all clients that are interested in this app
       * If no client is interested, then complete refresh without sending any
         events
       * Only clients that have a session open with the current app will
         receive any events and the session will also only close for only
         those clients

  DEPENDENCIES:
    None

  LIMITATIONS:
    None

  RETURN VALUE:
    mmgsdi_return_enum_type
    MMGSDI_SUCCESS:          The command processing was successful.
    MMGSDI_ERROR:            The command processing was not successful.
    MMGSDI_INCORRECT_PARAMS: The parameters supplied to the API are not
                             within appropriate ranges.
    MMGSDI_NOT_SUPPORTED:    When the file has an entry in the Service Table
                             but the service table indicates the card does not
                             have the support

  DESCRIPTION:
    This function will process the clients response to ok_to_fcn.

    This state will perform the following operations:
    1. If all have been received or any of them has resulted in error then
       transition to next state
       WAIT_FOR_INIT_COMPLETE_STATE
           a.If the mode is INIT/RESET(default)/INIT_FCN/INIT_FFCN/3G
             Session Reset(default)
           b.Send START event to relevant clients
           c.Send command to GSDI to start init if it is provisioning
             application.
        WAIT_FOR_FCN_COMPLETE_STATE:
           a.If all clients have responded with OK and mode is FCN
              i. Send START Event to all relevant clients
              ii.Transition to this state
        READY_STATE:
           a.Error Case - If any client has voted not to init
              i. clean up
              ii.send TR

                     will be freed later during refresh cleanup, make a shallow copy
                     to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and freeing.

                     Note:
                       Make sure set pointer type members to NULL before calling
                       mmgsdi_refresh_rsp_clean_up() on slot_index_cnf
                     and
                       If any of the following happens, better to make a deep copy
                       rather than adding more code here to avoid accidentally
                       introducing bugs since all the memory will be freed by
                       mmgsdi_refresh_rsp_clean_up() eventually.
                       1. mmgsdi_refresh_rsp_clean_up() needs to access pointer type
                          contents during cleanup
                       2. New pointer type member is introduced to mmgsdi_refresh_info_type
