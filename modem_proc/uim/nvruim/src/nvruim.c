                   order problem when call history read is in "absolute" mode
                   and write is in "previous" mode. Unlike speed dial numbers
                   call history information are stored in ruim card only.
1/28/01    wli     Added phone book support which includes speed dial (NV_DIAL_I)

                   and OTAPA_SPC_ENABLE.
01/08/01   ts      Fixed nvruim_read so that the esn checksum is returned with
                   the proper value whether or not the RUIM fails.  Changed the
                   reformat section of nvruim_read to allow forcing items to
                   debug values and reformat the data only if the value was read
                   properly from the RUIM.
01/04/01   ts      Changed writes to ESN and ESN checksum to return UNSUPPORTED.
                   This allows the ESN to be written to the NV memory.
12/19/00   ck      Changed the size of a 683A PRL returned on a read to reflect
                   the number of bits in the PRL rather than number of bytes.
12/13/00   wli     Copied ACCOLC, MOB_TERM_HOME, MOB_TERM_FOR_SID, and
                   MOB_TERM_FOR_NID to AMPS index.
                   Removed debug feature around NV_COUNT_I write.
                   Added debug code to force MIN1 and MIN2.
                   Fixed otapa_enabled flag bug.
11/28/00   wli     Suppot more nv items and SMS feature.
11/15/00   ck      Removed the parsing of result for MSISDN from Telecom dir
                   Added debug code to Unblock CHV
                   Grouped the processing of READ_ONLY RUIM items.
                   Added the function nvruim_set_esn_usage() that sets the
                   esn usage indicator to use ESN or UIM_ID.
11/06/00   ts      Added access to the MSISDN file in CDMA directory for
                   NV_DIR_NUMBER_I and NV_DIR_NUMBER_PCS_I.
10/13/00   ck      Grouped the items that return the write status as READONLY.
                   Modified the default Dir number to 858-555-1212.
                   Removed support for MS-ISDN.
10/11/00   ts      Changed failed RUIM accesses as NOT ACTIVE from FAILED.
                   Changed accesses to RUIM status to match new report type.
                   Copied MIN1 and MIN2 to index 0 of the MIN arrays to support
                   AMPS.  Added options for ESN failure.
09/18/00   ts      Added an ifndef around temp variables in nvruim_read to
                   prevent warning messages when NVRUIM_DEBUG_FORCE_DIR_NUM
                   is defined.
08/08/00   ms      Added nvruim_free to intercept NV_FREE_F calls
08/04/00   ms      Added SMS, SMSS, and SMSP support
06/22/00   ck      Changed the ifdef around writing Dir number to ifndef.
06/13/00   ck      Changed the feature around writing call count to
                   FEATURE_RUIM_ADM_ACCESS to prevent the Count from being
                   to the card as the interface needs to be changed.
06/12/00   ck      Changed the parsing of MSISDN to derive the MDN.
06/06/00   ck      Added the debug feature for writing dir number which
                   broke the service programming.
06/06/00   ck      Increased the array size from 10 to 11 to remove a compiler
                   warning.
06/06/00   ck      Rewrite the status to NOTACTIVE while reading NV_COUNT_I
                   when the debug feature is defined.
06/01/00   ck      Rewrite status to NOTACTIVE to support upper layer error
                   recovery and added a debug feature for writing call count
                   to the RUIM.
05/24/00   jah     Add MSISDN support.  Feature-ized debug support.
05/15/00   jah     Added short-cut exit for ADM protected EF writes
04/24/00   jah     Initial Revision

FUNCTION NVRUIM_READ_3GPDMIPUPP

DESCRIPTION
Check to see if the 3gPDMIPUPP item is supported by the R-UIM.
If it is supported, read it.

DEPENDENCIES
Non-reentrant

RETURN VALUE
NV_RUIM_ITEM_NOT_SUPPORTED    Item is not supported
NV_RUIM_SUPPORTS_ITEM Item is supported, see op_status

op_status indicates the success/failure of the read.  For items
which are "not supported", the value of op_status is undefined.

SIDE EFFECTS
nv_cmd_ptr will be modified with the op_status

FUNCTION nvruim_get_ipv6_hex_char_string

DESCRIPTION
   IPv6 have eight groups of 4 hex digits separated by colons.
   it also can have 2 colon :: together but only once is allowed in entire string.
   For example, all are pointing to same addresss:
   2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab
   2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000::1428:57ab
   2001:0db8:0:0:0:0:1428:57ab
   2001:0db8:0:0::1428:57ab
   2001:0db8::1428:57ab
   2001:db8::1428:57ab

   Data are stored in card as 8-bit ASCII string, where each character is
   store in one byte information. for example given string 2001:db8::1428:57ab
   is stored as
   32 30 30 31 3A -> 2001:
   64 62 38 3A 3A -> db8::
   31 34 32 38 3A -> 1428:
   35 37 61 62    -> 57ab

   This function will get IPv6 address byte from EF data buffer and stored in
   array of 8 word index. So for given example, output will be
   Ipv6[0] = 0x2001
   Ipv6[1] = 0x0db8
   Ipv6[2] = 0x0000
   Ipv6[3] = 0x0000
   Ipv6[4] = 0x0000
   Ipv6[5] = 0x0000
   Ipv6[6] = 0x1428
   Ipv6[7] = 0x57ab

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

RETURN VALUE
  TRUE:  When data buffer have valid ipv6 address data.
  FALSE: When data buffer will not have valid ipv6 address.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None
