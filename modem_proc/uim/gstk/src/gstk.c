GENERAL DESCRIPTION

  This source file contains the main GSTK task along with supporting functions.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  gstk_task_put_cmd_buf
    This function put the command onto gstk task command queue

  gstk_cmd
    This function allows clients to put the gstk_cmd onto the GSTK command
    queue.

  gstk_power_down
    This function flushes GSTK queue, vote UIM off and Ack TMC

  gstk_cm_ss_event_cb
    This function listens to CM SS events and will put a GSTK mode change
    command when appropriate

  gstk_test_automation_restart
    Called by test automation script via DIAG to soft restart GSTK

  gstk_switch_to_instance
    This function switches current context data (private data) to a specific
    instance assiciated with specified SIM slot id
