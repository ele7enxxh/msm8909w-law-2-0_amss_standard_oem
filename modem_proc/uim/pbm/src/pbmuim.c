 * The initialization chain for each SESSION is independent of each other and

 *
 * An initialization chain starts from pbm_*_fileinfo_internal() and ends with
 * pbm_app_init_completed().
 *
 * It includes getting file attribute for each SESSION file
 * (pbm_make_fileinfo_request()/pbm_fileinfo_cb()), allocating memory
 * depending on the number of records read from file attribute
 * (pbm_fileinfo_complete()) and for each file (pbm_init_entries()),
 * reading all data in the file (pbm_sim_read()/pbm_sim_read_cb()).
 *
 * pbm_session_initializing is set to TRUE when the above chain is in progress.
 *
 * pbm_init_fileinfo_internal() is used to initialize all SIM files.
 * pbm_start_fileinfo_internal() is used to start initialization based on
 * the files specified in pbm_fileinfo_requests.
 *
 * When either of them is called, if another initialization is going on,
 * the current initialization is deferred until the next callback where
 * pbm_restart_fileinfo_internal() picks it up.
 *
 * pbm_session_restart is used to notify the callback to start again.
 *
 * The callbacks also check whether an initialization should be stopped
 * (say SIM removed) by checking pbm_session_initializing.

  This is a function designed for analyzing the contents of the PBR File.
  It will take a pointer to an array of TLV Objects.  It will then
  go through this array to retrieve the FILE IDs.
  This function has support for 1000 phonebook entries.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  None.

COMMENTS
  This function is used when FEATURE_1000_PBM_SUPPORT is not defined
