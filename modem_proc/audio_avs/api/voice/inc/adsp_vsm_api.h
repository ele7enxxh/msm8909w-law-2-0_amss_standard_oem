  @detdesc
    This command creates the topology required for in-call audio delivery,
    connects to the external aud_ref_port or preassigned pseudoport for this
    use case, and starts reading samples from it. These samples are mixed with
    voice and sent over the air. The AFE_PORT_ID_VOICE_PLAYBACK_TX pseudoport
    is used. (For information on AFE, refer to @xhyperref{Q6,[Q6]}.)
    @par
    The audio samples are read from the external audio reference port or from
    the default pseudoport (AFE_PORT_ID_VOICE_PLAYBACK_TX) based on the command
    payload. If the aud_ref_port is 0xFFFF (invalid AFE port ID), the audio
    samples are received through the default pseudoport. Subsequent
    VSM_CMD_START_PLAYBACK_V2 commands that are made without issuing
    #VSM_CMD_STOP_PLAYBACK commands are rejected by the firmware for a given
    session.
    @par
    The client must make sure the audio samples from the audio path (in the
    case of a pseudoport), and from the external processor (in the case of
    aud_ref_port), are of 14-bit dynamic range. For an audio path, this can be
    done through the audio path calibration; for external audio, it can be
    calibrated through AFE port gain in the AFE_PORT_CMD_START command.
