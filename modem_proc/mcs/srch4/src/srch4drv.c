--------   ---     ---------------------------------------------------------- 
02/23/15   mn      Debug changes to catch 
                    "srch4drv.c:4167 Assertion fw_index < SRCH4_MAX_TASKS failed"

FUNCTION       SRCH4_PROCESS_STATUS_DUMP
DESCRIPTION    This function retrieves the results of the specified searcher4
                sweep. It fills the task structure then calls the specified
                callback function to process the dump.
DEPENDENCIES   Type of dump should have been checked (srch4_status_dump)
                This should not be a lost or an aborted dump (unless partial
                results are requested for aborted searches)

RETURN VALUE   None
SIDE EFFECTS   Srch4 structure is modified, processing callback is called
