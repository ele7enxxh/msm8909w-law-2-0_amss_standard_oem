     * The header size.

     * The message type selects the particular message processing behavior

     * The Eagle protocol defines four types of asynchronous messages each
     * having a different intent.
     *
     * APRV2P1_PKT_MSGTYPE_EVENT_V (0) selects the event message type. The
     * behavior and guarantees of event messages are message-specific and
     * service-specific.
     *
     * APRV2P1_PKT_MSGTYPE_SEQCMD_V (1) selects the sequential command message
     * type. Each sequential command message is processed only after the
     * previous command completes in FIFO order.
     *
     * APRV2P1_PKT_MSGTYPE_NSEQCMD_V (2) selects the non-sequential command
     * message type. Non-sequential commands are processed by the recipient
     * irrespective of any on-going sequential commands. Non-sequential
     * commands are reserved for special purposes. One such case is to avert
     * a sequential command processing deadlock when both the client and the
     * server send commands to each other. The server-to-client direction is
     * defined to have a higher priority than the client-to-server
     * direction. Thus server-to-client commands is restricted to
     * non-sequential command messages.
     *
     * APRV2P1_PKT_MSGTYPE_CMDRSP_V (3) selects the command response message
     * type. Command response messages are guaranteed to be returned by the
     * server to the client after commands have completed or have failed.
     * Command response messages typically carry return statuses.
     *
     * This value should be set to one of the four message types as defined
     * by the specific opcode and/or by the specific service.
