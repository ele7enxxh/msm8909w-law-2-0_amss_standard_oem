DESCRIPTION
  This function increments the RSSI measurement period counter if the
  RSSI measurement is in progress.
  The RSSI TGMP exist parameter is passed. The reason for that is
  that in case the RSSI measurement is in progess and RSSI TGMP is not
  existing then there is no use of increment this unnecessarily. It can
  overflow if the RSSI TGMP pattern is not activated soon enough.
  However in case enough samples have been already collected then
  RSSI meas measurement should be processed and sorted at the end of 480 ms.
  For this reason in case RSSI meas is in progress and RSSI TGMP is not
  existing now then RSSI meas period should be advanced upto 480 ms.

DESCRIPTION
  This function initializes the CM search and measurement related database,

    RSSI measurement
  - Initializes the cell pointers to NULL.
  - Set the GSM cell (active and deleted) counts to 0
  - RSSI measurement last GSM cell index to INVALID

    BSIC verification
  - Set the BSIC verification cell count to 0
  - Set the cell pointers to NULL
  - Set the GSM BSIC id and reconf cell index to INVALID

    Result processing
  - Set the RSSI measurement call back function

  This function grabs the W2G mutex, so callers of it do not need to wrap
  this function inside W2G mutex.

DEPENDENCIES
  This function must be called after the CM search drivers are initialized
  otherwise the result processing call back function will be over written.
