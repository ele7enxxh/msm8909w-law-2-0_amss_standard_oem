  This function may be invoked by RRC to grab the mDSP's current VCTCXO
  adjustment PDM value.  It returns the value from the register
  tcxoAdjAccumMsw.  The tcxoAdjAccumLsw register is not read.

  It may not be able to read the tcxoAdjAccumMsw register because the WCDMA
  mDSP image is not active, or the mDSP clock is not enabled.  In this case
  it returns either a previously read value if there is one or a default
  value if there is not.  It also returns a previously read or default value
  if we do not have WCDMA service.

  This value may then get passed into another RAT, like GSM, so the VCTCXO
  trk_lo_adj PDM can start at this previously good, tracking PDM value.  If
  VCTCXO has never tracked, the return value is unlikely to be of much help.

PARAMETERS
  None.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

RETURN VALUE
  uint16 - Latest VCTCXO adjustment PDM value, read straight from mDSP's
           tcxoAdjAccumMsw register.  If it can.  Otherwise, it returns
           a default or previous PDM value.
