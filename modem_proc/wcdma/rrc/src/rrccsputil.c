                   is NOT defined. When UOOS P2 feature is defined, CSP does LIST DB Scan

                   under feature flag FEATURE SKIP SIBS FOR FPLMN
03/27/07   vm      Added fix for CR 114936. The contents of CPHY_CELL_TRANSITION_REQ cmd sent
                   to L1 are now properly initialized, especially req_mask. Junk value of
                   req_mask was leading to NULL ptr access in WL1.
03/16/07   vm      Added fix for CR 109422. During foreground service search 
                   if a cell is found on which UE can camp on then set the 
                   var plmn_fnd_during_fgnd_svc_srch to TRUE. This var serves
                   two purposes:
                   (1) For UOOS, this var has been added to inform NAS 
                   (using var ue_oos in RRC_SERVICE_CNF) that service is available. 
                   NAS looks at this var to determine if limited service request
                   should be sent to RRC or not. Notice that with UOOS, SD always 
                   sends Automatic Service Request and it sends Limited Service Request
                   only when NAS informs SD that Limited Service is available.
                   (2) For non-UOOS, this var is used to NOT start the 10s No Service
                   timer which (without this fix) gets started when UE finds a PLMN
                   that belongs to forbidden LAI which is NOT correct because UE can
                   get Limited Service on this PLMN.
03/07/07   vm      Fixed CR 113511 - This was a corner case of last acquisition on the 
                   last of the supported bands failing at the same time the UOOS Twcdma 
                   timer expires in RRC.  Due to this, in the next awake period the 
                   acquisition database + FFS is found to be empty. Now, UE restarts 
                   the search and starts FFS  search (since ACQ DB is empty). But instead 
                   of returning next CSP substate as RRCCSP_CELL_SEL_WT_FREQ_SCAN_CNF, 
                   CSP doesn't update the next_substate and it keeps its default value 
                   of RRCCSP_NO_CELL_SELECTED. And in this substate Tw timer expiry is 
                   NOT handled and UE gets stuck. The fix is to update the CSP substate 
                   in this case to RRCCSP_CELL_SEL_WT_ACQ or RRCCSP_CELL_SEL_WT_FREQ_SCAN_CNF 
                   as the case may be.
03/05/07   vm      FEATURE_UMTS_UNIFORM_OOS_HANDLING_P2: agc value is now sent to L1 even when
                   uoos is not being followed - this is because L1 always looks at this value
                   when uoos p2 feature is defined.
03/04/07   vm      Added support for FEATURE_UMTS_UNIFORM_OOS_HANDLING_P2.
02/02/07   da      Made change to start 4s + activation time for DCH->FACH timer.
                   Part of fix for CR 109198
12/26/06   pk      Added support to use the default value of the access class barred list 
                   if DSAC restrictions are omitted.
12/22/06   bu      In rrccsp_is_current_band(), if the current CSP scan is DCH->FACH/PCH
                   scan and destination frequency is present, check if the specified band
                   is in the current supported band group instead of just the current
                   band, UE is camped on.
12/05/06   bu      If in rrc_csp_start_sel_on_mm_req(), rrc_csp_start_cell_selection()
                   returns a FAILURE, that indicates that during the previous cell
                   selection, UE had completed acquisition/full scan on all the
                   supported bands and so UE needs to:
                   1) Increment the uoos_num_cycles_completed
                   2) Set the uoos_new_search to TRUE &
                   3) Perform ACQ DB and full scan on the supported bands for the
                   available Twcdma time.

                   JAPAN_MCC3 and JAPAN_MCC4.
10/26/06   vm      Added fix for CR 104768 - for BPLMN search do not reset 
                   current_band and first_band_to_be_scanned every time ACQ DB
                   is scanned from the beginning. This is to ensure that 
                   full freq scan is first done on the most recent "band entry" in the
                   ACQ DB.
09/27/06   segu    Restricted the check to only for RRCCSP_SUIT_CELL_RESELECT_WT_SIB

                   in CSP internal database
06/15/06   vk      When out of service area is detected, then change the status of
                   variable hsdpa_hsupa_ind to hsdpa not available
06/13/06   segu    Added support for DSAC feature implementation
06/08/06   vm      Added support for new feature FEATURE_MCC_AND_850_800_BAND_COMBINATION.
                   1. Included header file rrcdata.h.
                   2. The function validate_dl_arfcn() used in the file is now called with additional 
                      arguments when the feature is defined. 
                   3. Changes related to setting the variable current_band correctly as it is used by SIB  
                      procedure during the camping process.
                   4. The function rrc_is_arfcn_valid() called by GSM to filter out W UARFCNs, now 
                      takes another argument - which is the PLMN on which the UE is camped on the 
                      GSM side when the function is defined. 
                   5. Added definition of a new function 
                      rrccsp_is_sib_mcc_and_850_800_current_band_comb_valid().
05/31/06   segu    cell access status is updated before sending a command to NAS
                   i.e. either RRC_SERVICE_CNF (or) RRC_SERVICE_IND
05/26/06   vm      Added support to initialize current_band correctly when
                   UE needs to scan the frequency in NV before proceeding
                   to ACQ-DB/Full-scan when RRC_SERVICE_REQ is received by RRC from NAS. 
05/15/06   sgk     Added chenges to support scaling factors for treselection in 
                   SIB3 and 4.
05/08/06   segu    Added support for RSSI optimazation
05/04/06   vm      Added support to read dual mode flag from PLMN_LIST_REQ instead
                   of relying on the MCM dual mode flag (which gets updated whenever
                   service request is received). 
04/24/06   vm      Added definition of new function rrccsp_is_current_band()
                   which is called by SIB procedure for SIB5bis support.
04/21/06   segu    Added support for feature EHPLMN under the compiler flag
                   FEATURE_EQUIVALENT_HPLMN  
04/18/06   vm      Added support to not camp for full service on any of the cells
                   if the frequency is barred. Details in CR 91997.
04/18/06   da      Modified code to support migration to Mar-06 Rel-5 ASN1 +
                   R6 Hacks
03/30/06   vm      Added support to start the PLMN list full freq scan timer 
                   for 3G to 3G Automatic/Manual PLMN searches also (both 
                   background and foreground). As long as this timer is active 
                   no full scans are done. 
03/15/06   vm      Added fix to not reset next_band_mask when RRC_SERVICE_IND
                   is sent to NAS. For details please see CR 89843. next_band_mask
                   is now also reset in the function rrc_csp_init_select_data().
03/15/06   siva    Fixing the warning for LINT 8.0
03/10/06   sgk     Added code to support sib4 extensions qhyst and t reselection 
                   for PCH and FACH states.  
03/07/06   vm      Added support to populate rrcueci_band_storage_type structure 
                   with band information for BC8 and BC9.
03/03/06   vm      Added support for doing Manual BPLMN search in background
                   when Manual PLMN List Search request is received when CSP
                   CSP scan type is LEAVING_CONN_MODE. Specifically, added support
                   to complete the manual search in foreground if UE is not able
                   to find service when scan type is LEAVING_CONN_MODE.
02/28/06  da/sm    Modified code to support migration to Dec-05 Rel-6 ASN1
02/21/06   vm      Added support for 1700_2100 AWS Band (IV) under feature name
                   FEATURE_WCDMA_BC4.
02/17/06   vm      Added support for 1700 band under feature name FEATURE_WCDMA_BC9.
02/16/06   vm      Added the following BPLMN optimization:
                   Doing Manual PLMN search in foreground when UE goes OOS in Idle Mode 
                   during Manual BPLMN Search. Earlier when UE went OOS during Manual 
                   BPLMN search, RRC was aborting the search and returning 0 PLMNs to the 
                   user. Now RRC automatically restarts the search if UE goes OOS in IDLE 
                   mode during Manual BPLMN search and completes it in foreground and returns 
                   the results to the user. 
02/10/06   vm      Added fix for initializing signal_strength to a default value
                   of 75 when RPLMN is added by default to available PLMN list
                   for Manual PLMN search request.
02/09/06   vm      Added fix to properly initialize BPLMN variables when Manual
                   BPLMN search is interrupted by LAU/RAU and the feature 
                   EATURE_PCS_850_FREQ_SCAN_NEW_OPTIMIZATION is enabled.
01/30/06   vm      Added the following BPLMN optimization: always adding serving PLMN 
                   to available PLMN list for Manual PLMN Search. For this a new function
                   has been defined - rrccsp_update_wtow_manual_bplmn_list_with_rplmn().
01/25/06   bd      Lint clean-up
01/23/06   vm      BPLMN Optimization for Automatically re-starting Manual 
                   BPLMN search after completion of LAU/RAU updates & added
                   support for not rejecting Manual PLMN search request when RRC state 
                   is Connecting/FACH/DCH and the establishment cause is Registration. 
01/23/06   kp      Added support for Transaction I.D in BPLMN Abort feature 
01/20/06   vm      Added support for getting GSM arfcns during Manual/Automatic
                   PLMN search so that acq attempt on some of the W channels can
                   be skipped to reduce freq scan times in PCS/850 bands. The 
                   changes are under feature flag FEATURE_PCS_850_FREQ_SCAN_NEW_OPTIMIZATION.
01/20/06   bu      For now updated the rrccsp_get_supported_band_list() to set the
                   band type for 900 MHz band to rrc_RadioFrequencyBandFDD_spare1. This
                   will need to be updated when the new Rel 6 ASN.1 changes are brought in.
                   All changes are under FEATURE_WCDMA_900.
01/10/06   bu      Corrected the check to determine if a WTOG PLMN search should be
                   initiated or not once a WTOW PLMN search is completed.
01/05/06   vm      Added support for starting the 10s No Service timer after UE
                   enters deep sleep instead of waiting for 12 full scans in deep
                   sleep before starting the 10s No Service timer.
01/05/06   vm      Added support for barring the correct GSM cell when WtoG CCO
                   fails because GSM cell is barred. Now function rrccho_is_wtog_cco_active()
                   is used to determine if CCO is in progress instead of function
                   rrccho_is_wtog_cco_in_progress() (which sets a certain flag due to
                   which UE is taken to idle incorrectly).
01/04/06   vm      Added support for barring the correct GSM cell when WtoG CCO
                   fails because GSM cell is barred.
12/23/05   bu      Added support to fill in the correct signal strength in the available
                   PLMN list by calling l1_get_rssi().
12/21/05   siva    Added support of maximum 40 PLMNs instead of 10 PLMNs in PLMN_LIST_CNF
                   to NAS and also changes for the array bound issue at the time of sending 
                   PLMN_LIST_CNF message to NAS when W+G PLMNs found are more than RRC_MAX_PLMNS
12/15/05   bu      Added support to not read SIB1 and SIB3 during manual PLMN scan. Changes
                   are under FEATURE_SKIP_SIB1_3_DURING_MANUAL_PLMN_SCAN.
11/28/05   bu      Added initial support for 900 MHz band under FEATURE_WCDMA_900.
11/23/05   vm      Added support for feature FEATURE_PCS_850_FREQ_SCAN_NEW_OPTIMIZATION.
                   The list size returned by GSM is initialized to 0.
11/22/05   vm      Added changes related to scanning ALL ACQ DB entries before
                   doing Full Scan. 
11/16/05   vm      Added more support related to BPLMN features.
11/10/05   sgk     Added check for rrc_nv_rel_indicator to be equal to
                   RRC_NV_REL_INDICATOR_REL5 before processing the rel 5 ies. 
11/08/05   vm      Added support for WTOW and WTOG Background PLMN Search.
11/01/05   vm      Added required support to try acquisition on the best cell in the active
                   set on Connected Mode -> Idle transition before trying ACQ DB. Earlier this
                   support was present only for DCH->Idle transition and was under a gcf flag.
                   Now the dependence on the GCF flag has also been removed.
10/27/05   bu      Use SIB4, if available, during DCH->FACH and DCH->PCH transitions.
10/26/05   vr      While sending RRC_SERVICE_IND,populate the gsm_nas_common_info
                   if this service_ind is for WTOG Cell Change Order.Typically in 
                   connected mode this information is not included in the service_ind.
                   But for WTOG CCO,NAS relies on this information to detect a change
                   in LAI.
10/21/05   sgk     Added rel5 support for delta qhcs and delta qrxlevmin
                   processing for Sib3 and Sib4.
10/19/05   sgk     Made change to set the s_interat value to 24 when the value
                   received is 10 (actual value 20) which means treat the ie as
                   absent. This will ensure that Squal is always <= SsearchRAT
                   and effectively make the UE behave as if SsearchRAT is absent
                   (min value of Qqualmin is -24).
09/21/05   da      Made change to call func rrc_notify_cell_id_change instead of 
                   rrc_notify_cell_id_change_cb_func to notify serving cell change
09/20/05   da      Calling func rrc_notify_cell_id_change_cb_func() when RRC_SERVICE_IND 
                   or RRC_SERVICE_CNF is sent to MM to notify registered function of 
                   serving cell id.
08/31/05   vm      Added support for scanning the frequency in NV before proceeding
                   to ACQ-DB/Full-scan when RRC_SERVICE_REQ is received by RRC from NAS.
08/24/05   vm      Due to RL failure, max cell selection time for DCH -> FACH 
                   transition is not limited to 3mins when UE is in W only mode. 
08/23/05   vm      Added ANY_PLMN support also in feature FEATURE_PCS_850_FREQ_SCAN_OPTIMIZATION.
                   Now for ANY_PLMN search, the flag "is_emergency_call" is set to 
                   TRUE in the interrat redirection request sent to GSM.
08/21/05   bu      Call rr_rrc_set_band_pref() even when UE is in WCDMA only mode.
08/18/05   vm      Modified the changes made in the last check-in.
08/17/05   vm      Added support for not barring a cell if SIM has not been

                   It's done in rrc_init_cell_selection_procedure().
01/06/04   bu      Fix for CR38647. Initialize the cell select quality measure
                   correctly from SIB11/SIB12. 
12/16/03   bu      For manual PLMN selection, don't check for forbidden LAIs
                   while updating the PLMN list. Update CSP internal
                   data with the network_select_mode received in RRC_SERVICE_REQ.
12/16/03   bu      Fill sttd information while sending CPHY_ACQ_REQ to L1.
12/08/03   bu      Fill in the GSM map common information in the SERVICE_IND to MM
                   only if RRC state is not CELL_FACH/URA_PCH/CELL_PCH.
11/07/03   bu      Added a check to avoid acquisition on a frequency which has
                   already been scanned as part of acq database scan.
10/29/03   bu      Changed rrccsp_get_neighbor_pccpch_parms() to fill in
                   the frequency.
10/08/03   bu      For GTOW cell reselection save the Qqualmin and
                   (Qrxlevmin + Pcompensation) information to send back to RR,
                   if the reselection attempt fails due to S criteria not being met.
08/11/03   bu      Added support for the emergency call restriction based on
                   Access Class restrictions in SIB3.
07/16/03   bu      Removed initialization of future cell reselection boolean as it's
                   no longer used.
07/11/03   bu      If the cell is reserved for future extension, treat the cell
                   as barred using the value "not allowed" in the IE "Intra-frequency
                   cell re-selection indicator" in rrc_csp_find_cell_bar_status().
07/01/03   bu      If the cell is not barred but reserved check if UE's Hi Access
                   Class is 11 of 15 and select/re-select this cell if in the
                   home PLMN, otherwise treat the cell as barred.
06/04/03   bu      While sending ACQ_REQ to L1 in rrc_csp_send_next_freq_to_l1()
                   set the ACQ mode correctly. Added support barred cell during
                   cell selection. All the changes are under
                   FEATURE_BARRED_CELL_DURING_CELL_SELECTION.
06/02/03   vn      When leaving Connected mode and on an OutofService area,
                   do not do a full freq scan if UE fails to camp on one
                   of the frequencies in Acq DB.
05/22/03   bu      Set the s_interrat_incl flag to TRUE/FALSE depending on the
                   presence of rrc_fdd_rat_list_present IE in SIB3.
04/30/03   bu      Converted the values for s_intrasrch, s_intersrch, s_interrat
                   s_limit_srchrat, s_hcsrat and q_Hyst_l_S received from SIB3 to
                   their actual value while sending the CPHY_CELL_PARM_REQ to L1.
04/25/03   bu      Filled the cause while sending ACTIVATION_IND to MM.
04/24/03   bu      Removed FEATURE_L1_ACT_TIME usage. Activation time will be
                   initialized in the l1_cmd_hdr_type.
04/17/03   bu      Stop the DCH->FACH timer in 
                   rrc_csp_release_chls_and_continue_cell_selection() if current
                   scan is RRC_CSP_CELL_DCH_TO_CELL_FACH_SCAN.
04/10/03   vn      No need to call measurement saving function here as it is
                   moved to LLC. This was needed to take care of issues due 
                   to queueing of RRC_RESET_L1_REQ in LLC.
04/03/03   bu      Changed pri_scr_code to scr_code in l1_acq_cmd_type.
04/01/03   vn      Save IntraFreq Meas Criteria before sending CPHY_IDLE_REQ
                   while in RRC_CSP_CELL_DCH_TO_CELL_FACH_SCAN. Invoking of
                   CSP-MEAS-L1 interface function call ensures L1 does not 
                   clear Meas reporting criteria on the next CPHY_IDLE_REQ.
02/28/03   bu      In rrccsp_find_access_control fixed the check for
                   rrc_hi_access_class. It is now checked with RRC_HI_ACCESS_CLASS_ABSENT
                   instead of RRC_HI_ACCESS_CLASS_MAX. In rrc_csp_verify_hi_ac_access
                   the home_plmn_id is set correctly.
02/27/03   vn      Added support for DCH->FACH directed freq and psc. Also
                   implemented timer going DCH->FACH, improvement in cell 
                   selection algorithm to check multiple times for directed
                   frequency and acquisition database before starting full
                   frequency scan. Removed processing for redundant acq types.
                   Removed function: rrc_csp_start_stored_initial_select_ctrl_
                   _in_curr_acq_type, changed name of rrc_csp_start_stored_
                   initial_select_ctrl to rrc_csp_start_cell_selection. Provided
                   actual implementation of rrccsp_is_selected_cell_utran_directed.
                   In rrc_csp_release_chls_and_continue_cell_selection, reset
                   curr_scan to CELL_SELECTION_SCAN.
02/25/03   ram     Even if SIB11 indicates that SIB12 is present, it is not gauranteed
                   to be present in the cell. Hence if SIB12 is not present in the
                   SIB database we should assume it was not present in the cell and use
                   SIB11 instead. Earlier we were ERR_FATALing if SIB12 is not present                   
02/21/03   kc      Corrected Feature Defintion by removing HO feature where not
                   needed

                   in MCM while sending the Activation Indication.Change under 
                   FEATURE_INTERRAT_HANDOVER_GTOW_RRC.
01/31/03   bu      Check available PLMN Id with NAS PLMN Id if the current scan
                   is not RRC_CSP_PLMN_LIST_SCAN in rrccsp_update_plmn_list().
01/31/03   bu      Initialized the cell_change_type to RRC_CHANGE_CELL_SELECTION if
                   the scan type is RRC_CSP_GSM_TO_WCDMA_CELL_RESELECTION_SCAN in
                   rrc_csp_send_ccm_cmd(). An error will be flagged if the scan type
                   is not known.
01/30/03   vn      Removed lint errors.
01/29/03   bu      Added support to default the cell reselection parameters to 0 in
                   case negative values are received. If SIB11/SIB12 is present then
                   fill in the cell select quality measure from it otherwise from
                   SIB3.
01/24/03   xfg     Removed the check for the available PLMN Id with NAS PLMN Id.
12/09/02   bu      Add the PLMN Id to the available plmn list only if the
                   BCCH and NAS requested PLMNs don't match.
11/22/02   bu      Added support for more types in l1_wcdma_acq_mode_type 
                   to support GSM to WCDMA idle mode cell reselection. This
                   structure is used while sending the CPHY_ACQ_REQ. Changes
                   have been made under the approprate feature definitions in
                   rrc_csp_send_l1_cmd().
11/19/02   bu      Added support for manual PLMN selection. Fill the appropriate
                   fields in the PLMN_LIST_CNF and send it to MM. Re-initialize
                   the CSP internal data after sending the confirm to MM. Added
                   rrc_csp_start_sel_for_plmn_list() to do scan all available PLMNs

                   to cell reselection in CELL_PARM_REQ.
11/15/02   bu      Support for L1-RRC interface changes. Use
                   l1_cell_sel_resel_info_struct_type in l1_cell_info_struct_type.
10/30/02   bu      Added support to set num_rats and rat list information in
                   CELL_PARM_REQ.
10/11/02   bu      Added support for GSM to WCDMA cell reselection. Added
                   rrc_csp_send_mm_act_ind() to send the activation indication
                   to MM on a successful cell reselection. All the changes are
                   under FEATURE_INTERRAT_CELL_RESELECTION_GTOW.
10/01/02   vn      Added stubs for rrccsp_is_selected_cell_utran_directed and

                   phy_chl_release. Cleanup of logic for doing indefinite scan -
                   indefinite scan not based on FEATURE_FOREVER_SCAN but on the
                   scan type now.
09/19/02   vn      Moved rrc_csp_send_l1_drx_req from CCM as DRX command will
                   now be sent by CSP.
09/09/02   bu      Removed the intialization of the SIM parameters - lo access
                   class, high access class, imsi, tmsi & ptmsi from
                   rrc_csp_init_int_data().
08/07/02   vn      Work with new Service Request that does not have SIM 
                   parameters except for Forbidden LAI List.
06/19/02   bu      Removed references to RRC_ACT_CNF in rrc_csp_mm_primitive_sent()
                   and rrc_csp_cmd_to_mm_needed() for Dualmode.
06/19/02   bu      Removed rrc_csp_send_mm_act_cnf_cmd() for Dualmode.
06/14/02   vn      Dualmode changes: When a scan is done and if feature 
                   FEATURE_FOREVER_SCAN is not defined, put lower layers to Idle 
                   state. In rrc_csp_continue_stored_initial_select_ctrl, do not
                   change the Current Acquisition Type in Internal Database to
                   ensure an acceptable cell is not selected when specific PLMN
                   is requested by NAS. Fill up available PLMN list in Service 
                   Confirm from internally stored list.
06/14/02   bu      Fixed a merged typo - added #endif after rrccsp_update_plmn_list().
06/14/02   bu      Use mm_as_service_state_T instead of rrc_service_state_e_type
                   and mm_as_cell_access_status_T instead of
                   rrc_cell_access_status_e_type for DUALMODE. Added a utility to
                   add a particular PLMN to the PLMN list to be returned to MM in the
                   SERVICE_CNF if we find a cell which is not barred and is not in
                   the forbidden LAI list.
06/05/02   bu      In rrc_csp_send_sib_cmd() filled the procedure field in 
                   GET_SPECIFIC_SIBS_REQ and GET_ALL_SIBS_REQ.

12/05/01   kc      Changes for June spec conversion.  Mainly asn changes
10/31/01   vn      Defined and added a call to rrc_csp_bcch_and_nas_lais_match
                   for comparing LAI of the acquired cell with LAIs in forbidden
                   LAI list. Added call to Is_bcch_plmn_an_hplmn to determine if
                   acquired cell belongs to HPLMN. 
10/29/01   vn      Fixed compiler warning.
10/25/01   vn      Added a new function rrc_csp_start_sel_out_of_service_area_
                   in_idle_state to handle Out of Service area scan in
                   Disconnected and Connecting states. All channels and pipes 
                   are released by this function.
10/22/01   vn      Support for Out of Service Area - Added intermediate functions
                   to start cell selection on leaving connected mode, on out of 
                   service area ind, on acting on a new service request. 
                   Utilities are added to continue existing cell selection and to
                   release all cahnnels and continue existing cell selection. 
                   The CSP events are changed to last MM primitives. Last MM 
                   primitives are updated on sending a command to MM. Introduced 
                   current scan type to differentiate between scans due to Out of
                   service area, leaving connected mode, Radio Link failure etc.
                   The cell transition type in CELL_CHANGE_REQ to CCM is set based
                   on the current scan type.
10/12/01   vn      Added utilities 1. to determine which command needs to be sent
                   to MM based on the last CSP event and current service status,
                   2. to find the new CSP event based on the command sent to MM.
                   3. to store data from RRC_SERVICE_REQ command.
09/26/01   vn      Added new function rrc_csp_send_chan_release that sends an
                   RRC_CHANNEL_CONFIG_REQ to release all channels. Added a function
                   rrc_csp_start_sel_leaving_conn_mode to start cell selection on
                   leaving connected mode.
09/17/01   vn      Added a function to send LAI_LIST_CNF for partial LAI_LIST_REQ
                   support. Note that the list has current PLMN if camped on a 
                   cell and has no element if not camped on a cell.
09/12/01   vn      Correctly set new_cell_access field in CELL_CHANGE_REQ to CCM.
08/31/01   vn      Support for frequency scan. rrc_csp_continue_stored_initial_select_ctrl
                   now calls rrc_csp_get_next_freq_scan_entry to get the next 
                   frequency for scanning once acquisition database is exhausted.
                   It further returns the type of frequency scan to the caller.
                   Added new functions rrc_csp_send_next_freq_to_l1 and 
                   rrc_csp_handle_no_available_freq.
08/08/01   vn      Corrected logic in rrc_csp_find_cell_bar_status that handles
                   cell barred indication. Added rrc_csp_find_rrc_cell_access, 
                   that calculates cell access status based on cell restrictions and
                   access control. Calls to rrc_csp_find_rrc_cell_access while
                   sending Cell Change Req, RRC Service Cnf and RRC Service Ind. 
07/06/01   vn      In rrc_csp_send_ccm_cmd, changed to not fill in cell specific
                   fields (PLMN, Cell ID, Scrambling code, Freq) in the command 
                   if this is a case of Cell Loss.
06/19/01   vn      Set the num_cn_domain correctly in RRC_SERVICE_IND and 
                   RRC_SERVICE_CNF going to MM.
06/13/01   vn      Added provision to send RRC_SERVICE_IND. Consolidated all MM
                   command sending functionality in rrc_csp_send_mm_cmd(). Added
                   rrccsp_fill_nas_cn_specific_info and rrccsp_fill_nas_common_info
                   to fill in NAS CN domain specific and common info resp.

03/20/01   vn      Added changes to work with the latest rrcmmif.h version 1.14. 
                   The changes here are due to changes in RRC_SERVICE_REQ, 
                   RRC_SERVICE_CNF and RRC_SERVICE_IND command data structures
                   in rrcmmif.h. References to forbidden RAI lists have also 
                   been removed. Utility to fill all fields of RRC_SERVICE_CNF.
03/19/01   vn      In rrc_csp_send_llc_cmd, don't care for passed NULL pointer.
03/16/01   vn      Changes for simplified cell selection: do not form a 
                   candidate list so that CSP settles straightaway for the
                   original cell. Added a new utility rrc_csp_send_llc_cmd
                   to send non-funneling commands to LLC. Updated to the new
                   l1_meas_sib_parm_struct_type based on 1.14 of l1rrcif.h.

                   for Cell Transition Req and RRC Reset Req.
03/02/01   vn      Added a utility rrc_csp_form_interim_cand_list to form 
                   interim candidate list from Acq entry.
02/13/01   vn      Removed usage of RRC_CSP_SPEC_PLMN_BIT as it was redundant.
                   Fixed SIB11 linked list processing in rrc_csp_send_l1_cmd
                   and rrc_csp_form_cand_list_from_sib11.
                   Fixed bugs during unit testing of rrc_csp_send_l1_cmd.
02/09/01   vn      Bugfix: Updated rrc_csp_verify_hi_ac_access and 
                   rrc_csp_verify_hi_ac_not_barred to shift bitmask.Added and
                   modified debug messages.
02/08/01   vn      Added support for Acceptable Cell Selection. Changed to 
                   search for non-barred, non-forbidden area cells of Any other
                   PLMN if such cells of specific PLMN are not found.
                   Moved compare_expected_cells from rrccspdb.c
01/30/01   vn      Updates to work with LLC command funneling scheme. Changed
                   to release cmd buffers when cmd is not sent (due to any 
                   reason)after a cmd buffer has been allocated.
01/22/01   vn      Added check to verify the presence of Access Class barred 
                   list in SIB3 before accessing it at all places. Split 
                   rrc_csp_stored_initial_select_ctrl to a Start and Continue
                   version for ease with implementation.
01/19/01   vn      Changed to work with new names and fields in l1rrcif.h r1.5
01/12/01   vn      Added utilities for forming and maintaining Candidate List 
                   and Rank List and for sending commands to L1, SIB, MM and
                   CCM. Also added a utility for filling Acq entry from SIB.

  -RRC functions that are called in ISR context or RTOS timer call back
  -RRC functions that indirectly gets called by L1/L2 /ISR/timer call back   
  For example: Fun1() gets called by L1. Fun2() is called by Fun1(). Now both  Fun1() & Fun2() should be NON demand paged,

DESCRIPTION       This function is responsible for finding the status of
                  Access Control due to Access Class Restrictions.

                  Note that this function doesn't care about Cell Barred status
                  OR Cell Reservations.

DEPENDENCIES
                  - SIB procedure should have SIB 3 available for this cell.
                  - The UE Access Class should be known.

RETURN VALUE
                  SUCCESS: Cell Access restrictions for this cell could be 
                           calculated.
                  FAILURE: Failure to find out Cell Access restrictions due 
                           to multiple reasons.
SIDE EFFECTS
                  None.

FUNCTION          RRC_CSP_CONTINUE_INITIAL_STORED_SEL_CNTRL

DESCRIPTION       This function continues with the already started Initial 
                  and Stored Cell Selection
                  It looks for a frequency for a "specific" PLMN or
                  "Any" PLMN. It saves its current search state in Current
                  Selection Controller Data.

DEPENDENCIES
                  This function is closely knit with 
                  rrc_csp_compare_expected_cell() and
                  rrc_csp_get_match_acq_entry().
                  A change in logic in either must be reflected in others.

RETURN VALUE
                  SUCCESS: A frequency has been found where Acquisition 
                           can be tried.
                  FAILURE: No frequency found (all exhausted). Time for a 
                           deep sleep ?

FUNCTION          rrc_csp_start_cell_selection

DESCRIPTION       This function is responsible for starting a New Stored or
                  Initial Cell Selection. It initializes the Selection Data
                  based on the passed requested PLMN before calling 
                  rrc_csp_continue_stored_initial_select_ctrl which takes off
                  from there.

DEPENDENCIES
                  None

RETURN VALUE
                  SUCCESS: A frequency has been found where Acquisition 
                           can be tried.

FUNCTION          RRC_CSP_COMPARE_EXPECTED_CELL

DESCRIPTION       This function compares the expected acq. type with the 
                  actual Acquisition status mask and PLMN status mask and
                  declares the actual cell as Better than/Same as/Below
                  the expected cell.
           
DEPENDENCIES
                  This function is closely knit with 
                  rrc_csp_continue_stored_initial_select_ctrl() and
                  rrc_csp_get_match_acq_entry().
                  The logic in this function to compare actual and expected 
                  cells is based on the logic in rrc_csp_continue_stored_
                  initial_select_ctrl() to search cells. A change in logic
                  in either must be reflected in others.

RETURN VALUE
                  RRC_CSP_CELL_BETTER_THAN_EXPECTED: Cell exceeds expectations.
                  RRC_CSP_CELL_AS_EXPECTED: Cell meets expectations.
                  RRC_CSP_CELL_BELOW_EXPECTED: Cell is below expectations.

SIDE EFFECTS
                  None.

FUNCTION          RRC_CSP_GEN_STATUS_MASK

DESCRIPTION       This function generates an Acq. status mask from Cell 
                  Barred status and LAI Status. The Acq. Status mask is
                  understood by Acq. database whereas Cell Barred status and 
                  LAI Status are understood by Cell Selection utility 
                  functions and Cell Selection state machine functions.
                  
                  This utility acts as an interpretor so that the status 
                  returned by Cell selection utilities can be compared with
                  the one returned by Acq. Database access functions.

DEPENDENCIES      None.

RETURN VALUE
                  A bit mask that represents Acq. status.

FUNCTION          RRC_CSP_SEND_L1_CMD

DESCRIPTION       This function is responsible for filling up data structures
                  for all L1 commands sent by CSP. This also allocates cmd
                  buffer and sends the command.
                  Since all L1 cmds go via LLC, the LLC command RRC_LLC_CMD_REQ
                  actaully encapsules the real L1 command. This is the LLC
                  command funneling mechanism.
                  It frees allocated command and embedded buffers
                  when failure is detected before sending the command.

DEPENDENCIES
                  The passed pointer should be pointing to a valid data.

RETURN VALUE
                  SUCCESS: Command was successfully sent to L1.
                  FAILURE: Command could not be sent due to any one of multiple
                           reasons.

                  It could be thru' devicing slightly different names for

DEPENDENCIES

FUNCTION          RRC_CSP_SEND_MM_PLMN_LIST_CNF_CMD

DESCRIPTION       This function is responsible for filling up data structures
                  for PLMN List Confirm command to MM sent by CSP.
                  This also allocates cmd buffer and sends the command.
                  It also frees allocated command and embedded buffers
                  when failure is detected before sending the command.

DEPENDENCIES
                  
RETURN VALUE
                  None

SIDE EFFECTS
                  For time being it always sends an PLMN_LIST_CNF with the 
                  no PLMNs.

FUNCTION          RRCCSP_IS_BAND_CLASS_ENABLED_IN_UI_RF

DESCRIPTION       This function is used to check if the band_class is enabled in
                  both the UI and RF.
                  The band_class passed to the function is added to the wcdma_band_mask
                  (CSP uses this band_mask to determine what all bands it should search
                  for when UE goes OOS), if the second argument passed to this function
                  is set to TRUE. E.g., when this function is called from inside the 
                  function validate_fdd_frequency()/validate_dl_arfcn() then the value 
                  of this argument is TRUE. This is because the function 
                  validate_fdd_frequency() is called when the frequency is received from 
                  UTRAN in SIBs or redirection or reconfig messages, etc. and for all these 
                  cases the design is that the frequency will be added to the wcdma_band_mask. 
                  Now, when this function is called from inside the function 
                  rrccsp_get_supported_band_list() then the value of the argument is always 
                  FALSE as the function rrccsp_get_supported_band_list() is called by UECI

FUNCTION     RRCCSP_IS_SIB_MCC_AND_850_800_CURRENT_BAND_COMB_VALID

DESCRIPTION

  This function is called by SIB procedure during cell selection once it reads the 
  MIB, to check if it should proceed further and read remaining SIBs for that cell.
  E.g., if the MCC in the MIB is Japan and the frequency is in the 800 band then the current
  band should be 800 otherwise the combination is invalid and UE should try the next
  cell/frequency. Similarly, if the MCC in the MIB is NOT Japan and the frequency is in the 
  800 band then the current band should be 850 otherwise the combination is invalid 
  and UE should try the next cell/frequency; etc.
  
DEPENDENCIES

  This function should only be called when the 850 or 800 band is supported, and the 
  UARFCN is in the overlapping region of 850 and 800 bands. 

RETURN VALUE

  TRUE - MCC, Frequency and Current Band combination is valid 
  FALSE - Otherwise

SIDE EFFECTS

  None.
