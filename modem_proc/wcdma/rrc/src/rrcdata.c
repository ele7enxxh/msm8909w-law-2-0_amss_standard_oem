                   rrc_get_ul_dcch_message_type() functions.
12/09/02   bu      Removed the checks for NAS and BCCH plmn being HPLMNs in 
                   rrc_bcch_and_nas_plmns_match().

                   number of digits actually present in the PLMN coming in MIB.
07/10/02   rj      Included cmwll.h instead of cmll.h
06/13/02   rj      Removed rrc_u_rnti_internal and rrc_u_rnti_short from this

03/05/02   rj      Renamed varible rrc_u_rnti to rrc_u_rnti_internal since 
                   VC++ debugger is confusing rrc_u_rnti variable with  
                   rrc_U_RNTI type declaration.
03/01/02   rj      Added code to return RRC state in function

                   a Re-establishment timer and to delete RBs associated with
                   a particular re-establishment timer. Also moved function
                   that appends START values from RRCRCE module since it is
                   common with Cell Update procedure. Added a function to
                   external RRC state indicator to internal RRC state. Also
                   Added Conversion function for Timer T305.
02/14/02   rj      Deleted variable rrc_c_rnti from RRCDATA module since 
                   Ordered Config maintains the same.
02/05/02   kc      Added var and function to update/initialize 
                   ue_conn_timers_and_constants

                   rrc_get_dl_ccch_message_type to return message choice 
                   similar to rrcasn1.h
09/14/01   xfg     Added function rrc_rssi_ber_timeout_handler to process the
                   RSSI & BER reporting timeout
09/12/01   ram     In function rrc_return_lc_info_for_rab used the functions
                   rrclcm_get_dl_rlc_lc_id and rrclcm_get_ul_rlc_lc_id to get
                   the required logical channels.
08/30/01   rj      Moved functions rrc_get_dl_dcch_message_type
                   and rrc_get_dl_ccch_message_type from RRC dispatcher since
                   these are required by other RRC procedures. Added comments
                   in the conversion functions.
08/28/01   kiran   Added function rrc_log_protocol_error to support logging of
                   protocol errors.  Right now it supports only QXDM logging

                   logical channel ids for user-plane RABs when requested by
                   user-plane entities. Right now it supports only CS data and
                   PS rabs.
07/27/01   rj      Modified rrc_convert_initial_ue_identity_into_int_value 
                   function to use global data.
07/27/01   rj      Modified release cause type to internal format from the external
                   format. Modified IMSI, IMEI and Initial UE Id conversion
                   functions from internal types to integers.
07/25/01   rj      Added a function rrc_convert_gsm_map_imsi_into_int_value to
                   conevrt ASN1 format IMSI to an integer value to be used by
                   RRC LLC.
07/20/01   rj      Added a new variable for V304 counter.
05/29/01   kmp     Updated rrc_translate_urnti().
05/17/01   ram     The functions to access the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS were
                   using the RAB id as the index to access the array. This
                   won't work for higher RAB numbers, so updated all the
                   functions to use a loop to find the correct index.
                   Added a new function rrc_remove_rb_from_established_rabs
                   which removes one RB from the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS.
05/16/01   vn      Updated rrc_translate_gsm_map_plmn_id to work with the new
                   rrc_plmn_identity_type.

04/29/01   rj      Modified definitions of C-RNTI and U-RNTI to internal format.
                   Added definitions for IMSI, TMSI and PTMSI. Added functions
                   to translate external format of  C-RNTI and U-RNTI into
                   internal format.
04/27/01   ram     Updated function rrc_translate_cell_id with the correct
                   interpretation of the ossBitString type given by ASN.1.
                   The function converts a bitstring of upto 32 bits into
                   a uint32 type.
04/26/01   ram     Added support for the UE Variable ESTABLISHED_RABS. 
                   Provided access functions for RRC procedures to 
                   add RABs to or remove RABs from this variable.
03/30/01   rj      Added functions rrc_translate_imei and 
                   rrc_translate_gsm_map_imsi. Modified RRC Connection 
                   Establishment cause and Initial UE Identity from external
                   format to internal.
03/23/01   ram     Added functions rrc_translate_gsm_map_plmn_id and rrc_translate
                   cell_id to translate the external (ASN.1) format of PLMN
                   and cell ids to the internal format used by RRC modules.
03/19/01   vn      Added rrc_translate_access_class_barred_list to translate 
                   access class barred list from ASN1 to RRC internal format.
02/12/01   rj      Added varibales rrc_protocol_error_information, rrc_v_308,
                   and rrc_release_cause for RRC Connection Release procedure.
01/25/01   rj      Moved rrc_dpch_info_present to RRCRCE module since is is
                   local to the RRCRCE module.
01/19/01   rj      Modified variables in this file global from LOCAL static.
12/22/00   rj      Added EDIT HISTORY Header
12/22/00   rj      Added variables for C-RNTI, U_RNTI, DPCH info present and 
                   capability update requirement that are required by the RRC

FUNCTION   rrc_update_rab_type_in_rab_info_r6

DESCRIPTION
 This function is updates the rab type in 'rrc_est_rab_info_type' structure
 using information stored in ASN1 'rrc_RAB_InformationSetupList'.
        
DEPENDENCIES

  There is no error checking done in this function. Its assumed that ASN1
  structure 'rrc_RAB_InformationSetup' is already validated.

ARGUMENTS:

  rrc_RAB_InformationSetup *: pointer to ASN1 structure,
  rrc_est_rab_info_type *: pointer to internal RRC est_rab structure in which this 
                                       function will fill appropriate rab_type.

RETURN VALUE

rrcrb_rab_e_type: returns the rab_type which is filled in est_rab_info

SIDE EFFECTS

  None.
