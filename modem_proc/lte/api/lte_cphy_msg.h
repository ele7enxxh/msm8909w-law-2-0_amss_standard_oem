  @brief  Defines the CPHY SAPs used to interface with L1.

  @detail

  This file describes the interface from upper layers to L1.  This interface
  is expected to be used principally by RRC, although there is a portion
  of this interface to be used by MAC as well.

  This interface is generated from
  $Header:

  @mainpage
  This documentation describes the L1 module.  The interface to L1 is
  broken down into @ref cphy_sap and @ref phy_sap.  L1 also exposes a
  test-only interface which exposes additional functionality to be used in
  PLT in @ref cphy_test_sap

    @detail RRC sends this message to request MIB/SIB decoding from L1. RRC
    includes a semi-static SIB schedule, and bitmasks that indicate which SIBs
    should be received. As SIBs are received, RRC can disable further
    reception by removing them from the bitmasks and sending another request.
    One bitmask controls which SIBs are received in the current modification
    period; this bitmask is always applied immediately by L1 to determine how
    to schedule SI message reception. Another bitmask controls which SIBs are
    received in the next modification period. This can be used to trigger a
    synchronized transition to a new schedule at a modification period
    boundary. RRC specifies the modification period boundary SFN in this case.
    L1 also sends a Boundary Indication to RRC if RRC includes the boundary
    SFN; this facilitates invalidation of parameters when SIBs change. Note
    that MIB decoding is implicit; L1 assumes that whenever SIB1 reception is
    active, it should also receive MIB. If RRC removes SIB1 from the bitmask,
    L1 assumes that it can also stop decoding MIB. If MIB is successfully
    decoded, L1 will also send a MIB Indication.
