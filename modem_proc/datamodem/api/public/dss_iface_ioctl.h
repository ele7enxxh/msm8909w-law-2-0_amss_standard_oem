FUNCTION DSS_IFACE_IOCTL()

DESCRIPTION
  This function dstermines the ps_iface_ptr associated with the passed in
  identifier (App ID). It then calls ps_iface_ioctl().

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS

  dss_iface_id_type         - Interface ID on which the specified operations
                              is to be performed

  dss_iface_ioctl_type      - The operation name

  void*                     - Pointer to operation specific structure

  sint15*                   - Error code returned in case of failure (Error
                              values are those defined in dserrno.h)

                              DS_EBADF - Returned by dss_iface_ioctl() if the
                              specified id_ptr is invalid (i.e. id_ptr does
                              not map to a valid ps_iface_ptr).

                              DS_EINVAL - Returned by dss_iface_ioctl() when
                              the specified IOCTL does not belong to the
                              common set of IOCTLs and there is no IOCTL mode
                              handler registered for the specified interface.

                              DS_EOPNOTSUPP - Returned by the lower level
                              IOCTL mode handler when specified IOCTL is not
                              supported by the interface. For instance, this
                              would be returned by interfaces that do not
                              support a certain "iface specific common IOCTL"
                              (i.e. these are common IOCTLs, but the
                              implementation is mode specific, for example,
                              GO_DORMANT).

                              DS_EFAULT - This error code is returned if the
                              specified arguments for the IOCTL are incorrect
                              or if dss_iface_ioctl() or a mode handler
                              encounters an error while executing the IOCTL..
                              For instance, if the 1X interface cannot
                              "GO_DORMANT" it would return this error.

                              DS_NOMEMORY - This error code is returned if we
                              run out of buffers during execution.

RETURN VALUE
  0 - on success
  -1 - on failure

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.
