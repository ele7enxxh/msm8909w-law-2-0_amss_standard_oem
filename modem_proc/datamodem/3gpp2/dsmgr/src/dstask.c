GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  This software unit contains the task entry point and the top-level dispatch
  routines for the Data Services (DS) Task. Functions to manipulate the Data
  Services Task's command queue are also included here.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
  ds_task()
    Data Services Task entry point

  ds_get_cmd_buf()
    Returns a command buffer

  ds_put_cmd()
    Puts a command on the Data Services Task command queue

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS INTERNAL TO DS SUBSYSTEM

  ds_release_cmd_buf()
    Releases a command buffer

  ds_get_cur_free_cmd_cnt()
    Returns the number of free command buffers

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  The DS Task should have been created before any calls to ds_get_cmd_buf()
  or ds_put_cmd().
