/** @ingroup cvd_mvm_cmd_create_passive_ctrl
  Creates a new passive control MVM session.

  The payload is the session name string used to identify the full control
  MVM session for which a handle is to be obtained. The string size, including
  the NULL termination character, is limited to 31 characters.

  Passive MVM sessions give clients access to UI controls, such as

  and vocprocs. The corresponding full control sessions internally manage
  additional system policies such as network settings and voice timing
  parameter settings.

  The CVD client must provide the calibration media type to the MVM, which
  uses it for two purposes:
  - Determining the Tx and Rx sample rates at which the system runs and for
    which the system is calibrated.
     - For fixed sample rate vocoders, the rates are then propagated to the
       streams and vocprocs attached to the system. Their sample rates are
       configured and indexed into the calibration table to apply the
       corresponding calibration data subset.
     - For variable sample rate vocoders, the MVM cannot determine the sample
       rates from the media type alone and requires the sample rates to be
       provided by the client; see #VSS_IMVM_CMD_SET_MAX_VAR_VOC_SAMPLING_RATE.
  - Determining the vocoder class and propagating it to the streams and
    vocprocs attached to the system. The class is indexed into the calibration

  - If the sampling rate specified for the payload is 0, it is a default

  Reconfiguration of PP sampling rates may occur after this command is sent as 
  the actual sampling rate setup on the system is an interal policy of CVD.
