/*
 * Events are used to send asynchronous notifications to the framework. During initialization,
 * the caller provides a callback function and a context pointer. The module can call this
 * function any time to raise an event. The appropriate payload must be sent based on the
 * event id. The callback is not thread-safe, so it must be called from the same thread context
 * as the interface functions. The payload data is copied before the function returns.
 *
 * Example:
 * Raising the KPPS change event:
 * capi_v2_event_KPPS_t payload;
 * payload.KPPS = 10000;
 *
 * capi_v2_buf_t payload_buffer;
 * payload_buffer.data_ptr = (int8_t*)(&payload);
 * payload_buffer.actual_data_len = payload_buffer.max_data_len = sizeof(payload);
 *
 * capi_v2_err_t result = event_cb_ptr(context_ptr, CAPI_V2_EVENT_KPPS, &payload_buffer);

    miss. This event must be raised when the module gets
    enabled and whenever the KPPS requirement changes.

   CAPI_V2_EVENT_BANDWIDTH, /** Used to indicate the bandwidth requirement (in bytes per second)
    of the module. This event must be raised when the module gets
    enabled and whenever the bandwidth requirement changes. The bandwidth
    must be specified separately for code and data. The bandwidth must be
    calculated assuming no cache.
    Payload Structure: capi_v2_event_bandwidth_t */
   CAPI_V2_EVENT_DATA_TO_DSP_CLIENT, /** Used to send data to the DSP's client apps processor. The
    module must specify a param id to indicate the type of data that
    is present in the payload. It can also specify an optional token
    to indicate additional information such as an instance identifier.
    It must then provide the payload in a buffer. The buffer can be
    safely destroyed or reused once the callback returns.

   CAPI_V2_EVENT_DATA_TO_OTHER_MODULE, /** Can be used to send data to another module in the aDSP.
    The destination service is identified by a service id
    that is provided to the module by the client using the
    CAPI_V2_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ID property. If the destination module
    resides in the same service as the current module, the
    id CURRENT_SERVICE_ID must be used. In addition to the
    service id, the module must specify the module id, the
    index of the module in the topology of the destination
    service (the index of the first module with the given
    module id is 0, the index of the second module with the
    same module id is 1 and so on), the param id and the
    payload that will be used to call set_param on the
    destination service. No acknowledgment is provided.
    A success return code just indicates that the message
    was sent correctly. Any acknowledgment must be explicitly
    sent by the destination module.

    call to the process() function, it is assumed that
    any data output from this process() function will be
    using the old media type. Subsequent calls to process()
    will output data of the new media type. If the module
    wants to immediately output data of the new media type,
    it must exit process() with zero output and wait for
    process() to be called again.
    Payload Structure: capi_v2_set_get_media_format_t */
   CAPI_V2_EVENT_PROCESS_STATE, /** This event is sent to the client to indicate if the module is enabled
    or disabled. The module is considered enabled by default. It is
    recommended that the module disable itself if it is not doing any
    processing. The process() function of the module will not be called
    until it raises this event again to enable itself.

    microseconds.
    Payload Structure: capi_v2_event_algorithmic_delay_t */
