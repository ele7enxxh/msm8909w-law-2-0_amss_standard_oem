/**
 * Process local storage is local storage for the hlos process context.
 *
 * Warning, this API should only be called from within a thread started by FastRPC, and not from
 * any user created threads via the qurt apis.
 * 
 * When used from within a FastRPC started thread this will attach
 * desturctors to the lifetime of the HLOS process that is making the
 * rpc calls.  Users can use this to store context for the lifetime of
 * the calling process on the hlos.
 *
 * Recovering instances
 * --------------------
 *
 * To maintain the same instance structure for a caller from the HLOS users
 * can use the HAP_pls_add_lookup api, which will lookup the key, and add it
 * if its not already present.
 * For example:
 *
 *    static int my_instance(struct my_struct* me)  {
 *       return HAP_pls_add_lookup((uint32)my_ctor,   //type, some unique static address
 *                                  0,                //key, for different type instances
 *                                  sizeof(*me),      //size of our struture
 *                                  my_ctor,          //structure ctor
 *                                  0,                //aditional user context for ctor
 *                                  my_dtor,          //desturctor
 *                                  &me);             //result
 *    }
 *
 * First call to my_instance will initialize the structure by allocating it and calling my_ctor.
 * Second call to my_instance will return the created instance.
 * This API is thread safe, but when two threads try to intialize the structure the first 
 * time they may both create an instance, but only 1 will be returned.
 * The destructor will be called when the HLOS process exits.
 *
 * See HAP_pls_add and HAP_pls_add_lookup.
 *
 * Exit Hooks
 * ----------
 *
 * Users can use either HAP_pls_add_lookup or HAP_pls_add to add a destructor that will be
 * called when the HLOS process exits.  The main difference between the two functions is that 
 * HAP_pls_add will always add, and the last instance added will be the one returned by 
 * HAP_pls_lookup.
 *
