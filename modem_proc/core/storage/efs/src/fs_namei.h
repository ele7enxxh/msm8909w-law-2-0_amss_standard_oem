/* The namei structure contains information about pathnames as they are
 * traversed.  The 'path' field points to the original base of the path.
 * The 'next' field points to the beginning of the particular component we
 * are interested in.  'len' is the number of characters in the component
 * name (up to the '/' or end of the string).
 *
 * dvp, and vp are a vnode pair used to walk down the directory.  dvp is
 * the vnode of the directory we are interested in looking in, can be
 * thought of as the parent.  The vp is the result node from the lookup.
 *
 * All of the necessary fields are filled in by fs_namei when the lookup
 * happens.

 * parent directory of this component.  Each will have an increased
 * reference count (on successful return).
 *
 * 'flag' can be used to determine if the last component of the path need
 * exist.  It should be a combination of O_EXCL and O_CREAT or'd together,
 * having the following meanings.
 *
 * 0 - the file must exist.
 * O_EXCL - not sensical, errors whether the file exists or not.
 * O_CREAT - the file need not exist.
 * O_EXCL | O_CREAT - The file must not exist.
 *
 * Returns 0 or a negative errno indicating the error condition.
