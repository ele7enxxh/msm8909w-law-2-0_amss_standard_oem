                Multi-Image Boot Partition Table Definitions

DESCRIPTION
  This header file gives the external definition of Partition Table,
  located in page 1 of the fourth and fifth non-bad blocks in NAND 
  flash for Multi-Image Boot targets.
  
  There are two copies of the data in these blocks which allow us to 
  alternate between them and always have a good copy which points to 
  valid boot loader, even if a programming operation is accidentally
  interrupted
