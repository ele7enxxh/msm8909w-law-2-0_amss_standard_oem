                Multi-Image Boot Information Block Definitions

DESCRIPTION
  This header file gives the external definition of the Boot Information
  Block, located in page 0 of the fourth and fifth non-bad blocks in NAND 
  flash for Multi-Image Boot targets.
  
  There are two copies of the data in these blocks which allow us to 
  alternate between them and always have a good copy which points to 
  valid boot loader, even if a programming operation is accidentally
  interrupted.
  
  NOTE:  Even though this block will contain various headers, each one
         of them is in its own page, so there is not a single structure
         which would encompass them all.  As each page is read in, the
         appropriate structure pointer should be applied, based on the
         structure being accessed.

 * area.  If so, then we need to search through at least 82 blocks
 * plus the number of good blocks we are requiring in the MIBIB area.
 * That number is 16 blocks.  Adding together, we get 98, so for
 * good measure, we will use a round 96 (0x60) blocks.  This will have a
 * speed impact when the flash is completely erased, but when there
 * are actually MIBIB images in the flash we will stop looking when
 * we find the MIBIB.
