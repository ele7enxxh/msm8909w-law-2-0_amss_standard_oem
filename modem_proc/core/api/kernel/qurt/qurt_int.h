/**@ingroup func_qurt_interrupt_register
  @xreflabel{sec:interrupt_register} 
  Registers the interrupt.\n
  Enables the specified interrupt and associates it with the specified QuRT signal object and
  signal mask.

  Signals are represented as bits 0-31 in the 32-bit mask value. A mask bit value of 1
  indicates that a signal is to be waited on, and 0 that it is not to be waited on.

  When the interrupt occurs, the signal specified in the signal mask is set in the signal
  object. An interrupt service thread (IST) conventionally waits on that signal in order to
  handle the interrupt. The thread that registers the interrupt is set as the IST thread.

  Up to 31 separate interrupts can be registered to a single signal object, as determined by
  the number of individual signals the object can store. (Note that signal 31 is reserved by
  QuRT.) Thus a single IST can handle several different interrupts.

  QuRT reserves some interrupts for internal use -- the remainder are available for use by
  applications, and thus are valid interrupt numbers. If the specified interrupt number is
  outside the valid range, the register operation returns the status value QURT_EINT.

  Only one thread can be registered at a time to a specific interrupt. Attempting to register
  an already-registered interrupt returns the status value QURT_EVAL.

  Only one signal bit in a signal object can be registered at a time to a specific interrupt.
  Attempting to register multiple signal bits to an interrupt returns the status value
  QURT_ESIG.

  @note1hang The valid range for an interrupt number may differ on target execution
             environments other than the simulator. For more information see the
             appropriate hardware document.

 * Waits for registered interrupt signal

 * Suspend the current thread until one of its registered interrupts occurs. The second input, "mask", 
 * contains the interrupt signals the IST expects to receive. The interrupt signals are registered 
 * with interrupts via qurt_register_interrupt API.
 *
 * The signals returned in "signal" variable indicate which interrupts occurred. Use function 
 * qurt_anysignal_get to read the signals. IST shall locally maintain a table that maps a signal to 
 * a specific interrupt. IST shall also check if signal SIG_INT_ABORT is received. If so, the IST 
 * shall quit from interrupt receiving loop.

/**@ingroup func_qurt_interrupt_acknowledge
  Acknowledges an interrupt after it has been processed.\n
  Re-enables an interrupt and clears its pending status. This is done after an interrupt has been
  processed by an interrupt service thread (IST).

  Interrupts are automatically disabled after they occur. To re-enable an interrupt, an IST
  performs the acknowledge operation after it has finished processing the interrupt and
  just before suspending itself (i.e., by waiting on the interrupt signal).

  @note1hang To prevent subsequent occurrences of the interrupt from being lost or reprocessed,
           an IST must clear the interrupt signal (Section @xref{sec:anysignal_clear}) before
           acknowledging the interrupt.

  Disables the specified interrupt and disassociate it from any QuRT signal object.
  If the specified interrupt was never registered (Section @xref{sec:interrupt_register}), the deregister operation
  returns the status value QURT_EINT.

  @note1hang If an interrupt is deregistered while an interrupt service thread (IST) is waiting
             to receive it, the IST may wait indefinitely for the interrupt to occur. To avoid
             this problem, the QuRT kernel sends the signal SIG_INT_ABORT to awaken an
             IST after determining that it has no interrupts registered.
