  If a thread performs a lock operation on a recursive mutex that is not being used, the
  thread gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex, and continues
  executing.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a recursive mutex that is already being used by
  another thread, the thread is suspended. When the mutex becomes available again
  (because the other thread has unlocked it), the thread is awakened and given access to the
  shared resource.
