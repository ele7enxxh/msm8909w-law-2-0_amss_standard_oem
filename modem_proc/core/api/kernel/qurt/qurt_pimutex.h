              use. Failure to do this causes resource leaks in the QuRT kernel.\n

/**@ingroup func_qurt_pimutex_lock
  Locks the specified priority inheritance mutex.\n
  If a thread performs a lock operation on a priority inheritance mutex that is not being used,
  the thread gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex, and continues
  executing.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a priority inheritance mutex that is already
  being used by another thread, the thread is suspended. When the mutex becomes available
  again (because the other thread has unlocked it), the thread is awakened and given access
  to the shared resource.

  If a thread is suspended on a priority inheritance mutex, and the priority of the suspended
  thread is higher than the priority of the thread that has locked the mutex, then the thread
  with the mutex acquires the higher priority of the suspended thread.
  The locker thread blocks until the lock is available. 
 
  @note1hang  A thread is not suspended if it locks a priority inheritance mutex that it has
              already locked, but the mutex does not become available until the thread
              performs a balanced number of unlocks on the mutex.\n
  @note1cont  The lock operation is significantly slower for priority inheritance mutexes
              than it is for recursive mutexes: in particular, about 10 times slower when the
              mutex is available for locking, and significantly slower (with greatly varying
              times) when the mutex is already locked.

/**@ingroup func_qurt_pimutex_unlock
   Unlocks the specified priority inheritance mutex.  \n
   More than one thread can be suspended on a priority inheritance mutex. When the mutex
   is unlocked, only the highest-priority thread waiting on the mutex is awakened. If the
   awakened thread has higher priority than the current thread, a context switch occurs.

   When a thread unlocks a priority inheritance mutex, its thread priority is restored to its
   original value from any higher priority value that it acquired from another thread
   suspended on the mutex.

  If a thread performs a try_lock operation on a priority inheritance mutex that is not being
  used, the thread gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex, and
  continues executing.
  If a thread performs a try_lock operation on a priority inheritance mutex that is already
  being used by another thread, qurt_pimutex_try_lock immediately returns with a
  nonzero result value.
