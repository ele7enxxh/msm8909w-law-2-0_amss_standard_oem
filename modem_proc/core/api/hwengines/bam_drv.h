  @file bam_drv.h
  @brief Public interface include file for the BAM driver initialization.

  This file contains definitions of interfaces that provide construction and
  destruction operations of the BAM drive.

  These APIs are only intended to be called from a single threaded environment
  and during subsystem initialization ( ex. rcinit, boot loaders )

  Clients of BAM driver are not expected to call these routines directly.
