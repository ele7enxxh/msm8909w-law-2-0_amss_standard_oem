NPA client API. This is NOT the API for resource authors. 

The interface uses strings and opaque types. This is done intentionally to
minimize client dependencies on the implementation. The data structures and
implementation can change radically without requiring changes to client code.

 * initial request.
 *
 * If the named resource does not exist or it exists but doesn't
 * support the requested client_type, a NULL handle will be
 * returned. Callers are expected to check for NULL handles.
 *  
 * A client must never attempt to use a NULL handle to update a
 * resource.
 *
 * The client_name must be < 64 characters in length.

 * The client_name string is not copied.  Any string pointer passed to
 * the framework must be immutable. It is hoped that future versions
 * will relax this restriction.

 * If non-NULL, the DAL event will be triggered when the asynchronous
 * request has completed.  If the DAL Event is a callback, it will be
 * invoked with the following arguments (context, 0, client_handle,
 * sizeof(client_handle) );
 *
 * Restrictions: 
 *
 * In general, the same client can not have multiple simultaneous
 * requests issued.  It is the responsibility of the user to make sure
 * the previous request has completed before issuing a new request via
 * the same client.
 * 
 * Due to current limitations in DALSYS, async client requests can not
 * be issued while INTLOCK'd.
