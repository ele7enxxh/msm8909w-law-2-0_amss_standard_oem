 * state vector. In either case, an enabled node will have its driver
 * function invoked with an INITIALIZE client, so it can reset as
 * necessary.

 * If the default state vector is NULL, resources will be initialized

 * subsequent invocations, and if you are using this function in that
 * circumstance, the expectation is that the driver can be unloaded and
 * the framework has no way to validate the callback function pointer
