--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
08/13/13   rks     Added new API q_retrieve_after
06/05/12   rks     Added new API to  q_insert_after
03/16/11   llg     (Tech Pubs) Edited/added Doxygen comments and markup.
11/11/10   EBR     Doxygenated File.
31/03/09   sri     Implemented q_destroy(api)
10/30/07   hal     Fixed errors in q_linear_delete
12/11/06   sgh     Enabled mutex for WinMobile
01/10/06    ck     Added prototype for q_delete_ext function that returns a 
                   boolean
05/16/02    gr     Added macro Q_ALREADY_QUEUED.
09/28/01    gr     Merged in changes from the MSP archive. Includes
                   queue-specific mutual exclusion for Win32 targets and the
                   new function q_linear_delete. Removed support for UTF_ASP.
01/25/01   day     Merged from MSM5105_COMMON.00.00.05.

                   Re-arranged data in link structures to fix bugs that were

                   FEATURE_Q_NO_SELF_QPTR was not.
                   Introduced q_last_get().
                   Added extern "C" to allow this file to export the queue
                   routines to a C++ program.  Changed use of word to int to 
                   count the number of elements in a queue.  Upgraded comments
                   to include function headers.  Removed the inclusion of
                   comdef.h since it is no longer needed.
                   Added macros to support renaming of queue functions and
                   to intercept calls to queue functions.
