@brief 
This file describes Logging Service APIs

@details
  The logging service allows clients to send information in the form of a 
  log record to the external device that is collecting logs (i.e., QXDM).

@note  
  Important usage note:
  The logging service uses a memory management system for logging outbound 
  information.  Due to limited resources, this memory management system is a
  FIFO queueing system with no garbage collection.  Queue insertion occurs at
  the time a logging buffer is allocated, not when it is commmited.  When you
  allocate a buffer, that buffer blocks the emptying of the FIFO until that 
  log record is commmited.  Therefore, if you hold onto a buffer for a long 
  time, no other log records can be sent until you commit (or free) your 
  buffer.  If you need to accumulate data for a log record, you must 
  accumulate it in your own memory space, not the memory allocated by the 
  logging service.  When ready to send, call log_submit().

@defgroup log_service Diagnostic Logging Services

The purpose of the Logging Service is to enable clients to send information to the external device
when it is available, rather than when requested from the external device. 
  
@par
  
The external device has the ability to individually configure (enable/disable) 
any log packet in DMSS. All log packets must conform to a published format, 
identified by the log code. Each log packet must begin with a member of type 
log_hdr_type. The header contains the log code, length, and timestamp. 
The Logging Service is not reliable. If resources are insufficient, the log service 
may drop a log by returning NULL from log_alloc(). 

@par

Log Record Header Type:
   Currently, all log records structure definitions must begin with
   log_hdr_type.  This place holder is needed for the internal 
   implementation of the logging service to function properly.
@note
   
   Do not reference this header directly.  In planned future
   versions of this service, this type will be typedef void, and the header
   will be transparant to the user of this service.  Any direct reference
   to this type will not compile when this enhancement is implemented. 
   Some clients, for legacy reasons, reference the log header.  Until those
   references are cleaned up, the logging service must expose the header
   to avoid compilation failure.

  MACRO LOG_RECORD_DEEFINE

  These macros were defined to provide and enforce naming
  conventions for declaring packets.  However, these macros
  make editor tags useless and add consufion.  The use of
  these macros has been deprecated, but is included here for
  compatibility with existing usage.  The naming convention
  enforced by these macros is not required for use of this
  service.

@note  
  It is not recommended to continue use of these macros.
  
  All that is required for defining a log structure is to place
  a member of 'log_hdr_type' at the top of the structure.  Do not
  access this member directly as this type is slated to be type-cast
  to 'void' when extending the logging service beyond 16-bit log codes.

  The naming convention enforced by these macros is outlined
  below:
  
  Log codes use the naming convention LOG_xxx_F.
  
  This macro expands the name of the defined structure to be:
