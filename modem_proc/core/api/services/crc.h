--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
03/16/11   llg     (Tech Pubs) Edited/added Doxygen comments and markup.
11/09/10   EBR     Doxygenated File.
04/06/05   ss      Moved 32-bit crc related declaratoin from hdrcrc.h to this 
                   file.
11/29/01   lad     Added step-wise CRC30 calculation.
03/17/99   ms      Removed comments related to bb_ for Virtual Boot Block.
12/16/98   jct     Removed 80186 support
09/21/98   jct     Incorporate ARM porting changes, cdecl changes
02/28/96   dna     Changed crc_16_l_table extern to be a pointer so the 
                   macro now accesses the table through the Boot Block jump
                   table.
06/21/93   jah     Corrected CRC_16_L_OK to match with crc_16_l_calc().
06/07/93   jah     Added prototype for crc_16_l_calc(), and improved comments
                   for CRC_16_L_STEP().
04/26/93   jah     Added extern for crc_16_l_table[] for macro.
04/22/93   jah     Added CRC definitions and macro to support CRC CCITT-16
                   processed LSB first.
07/09/92   jah     Changed crc_16_step() from bits to bytes
06/18/92   jah     Ported from brassboard and converted to table-driven.
