  Reads shared memory log events from a specified area into a provided buffer.
   
  This function reads up to event_count log entries from the log specified by 
  log_area into the memory pointed to by events. The function maintains the 
  last read position.

  If the log wrapped and overwrote log entries before they 
  could be read on this processor, *lost_count is set to the number of 
  entries that were lost. The function returns the number of log entries that 
  were read into local memory.

  The client is responsible for calling the smem_log_read() function at an 
  appropriate interval so that log entries are read from the SMEM log before the 
  log is overwritten by new log entries. This function guarantees that all log 
  entries returned from the function will be valid and complete, but does not
  guarantee that no log entries will be lost. The client can use the value 
  returned by lost_count to request changes in the size of the log at compile 
  time, or to increase the frequency at which the log is read.

  Only log areas configured as SMEM_LOG_READWRITE can be read using 
  smem_log_read() to prevent a race condition when smem_log_read() tries to read 
  an entry that has not been fully written. The static log and new logs are
  configured as SMEM_LOG_READWRITE, which keeps the spinlock locked until the 
  entire log entry has been written, eliminating the possibility for this 
  race condition.

                           log was last read.

                                 determine the buffer size to pass to this
