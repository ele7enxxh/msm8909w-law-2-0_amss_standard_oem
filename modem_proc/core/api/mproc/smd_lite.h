 * SMD Lite provides reliable, in-order, datagram-based interprocessor
 * communication over shared memory. Clients receive notification via a
 * callback when the port's status changes and may call the read or write
 * functions from the callback or notify their own threads for further
 * processing.
 *
 * All ports preserve message boundaries across the interprocessor channel; one
 * write into the port exactly matches one read from the port.
