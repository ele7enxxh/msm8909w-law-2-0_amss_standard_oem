/**
 * Posix permission bits.  Simple posix file permissions use a 3-level ACL,
 * with three privilege bits at each level.  The bits are read, write, and
 * execute.  Read and write have their obvious meaning for regular files.
 * Execute is currently not used by EFS2 (but could be checked).  For
 * directories, the meaning of the bits is a little different:
 *   - Read - Grants permission to open files in the directory.
 *   - Write - Grants permission to modify the "directory" (create, remove,
 *             or rename files)
 *   - Execute - Grants permission to search the directory (opendir).
 *
 * The three levels are "User", "Group", and "Other".  Currently, only
 * 'user' is defined in EFS2.  (Actually, none of these are checked).
 *
 * The values for these permissions are traditionally represented by octal
 * constants.  These defined values are a mixture of Posix and BSD
 * definitions.
 *
 *
 * FAT filesystems do not have Posix mode bits, so some translation is
 * required:
 *
 * FAT's "READONLY" attribute is represented by no write permissions
 * for all of user/group/other.  If one or more of these three has
 * write permission, then the file is not READONLY.
 *
 * FAT's "HIDDEN" attribute is uncomfortably shared with the Sticky
 * bit, S_ISVTX for now.
 *
 * FAT attributes should be avoided as much as possible, as
 * interpretations may change in future EFS versions.
