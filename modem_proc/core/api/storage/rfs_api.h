/**
 Open a file in the filesystem. If successful, the resulting file descriptor
 will be the smallest available non-negative integer that can be used as a
 handle to refer to this file in the calls described below. Each open file
 descriptor maintains its own file offset and open flags.

 @param path
    The path of the file that needs to be opened.

 @param oflag
    The 'oflag' argument describes how this file should be opened, and
    contains one of the following values:\n
      RFS_O_RDONLY  - Open for reading only.\n
      RFS_O_WRONLY  - Open for writing only.\n
      RFS_O_RDWR    - Open for reading and writing.\n\n
    In addition, the following flags can be bitwise OR'd with this value:\n
      RFS_O_APPEND  - All writes will self-seek to the end of the file before
                  writing.\n
      RFS_O_CREAT   - Create the file if it does not exist.\n
      RFS_O_TRUNC   - Truncate the file to zero bytes on successful open.\n\n
      RFS_O_ENCRYPT - Encrypt the data before saving in backing store.\n\n
      RFS_O_COMPRESS- Compress the file before saving in backing store.\n\n

 @param mode
    This option is not implemented currently and kept for API future
    compatibility.
    If O_CREAT is a part of 'oflag', mode argument will be used to define the
    file permissions given to the newly created file. \n


 @return
    Returns a file descriptor >= 0 on success and -ve value on failure that
    indicates the exact reason of failure as defined in rfs_errno.h.

 @b Example

 @code
    int fd, result;
    char buff[100];
    int32 offset;

    fd = rfs_open ("/file1", RFS_O_RDWR | RFS_O_TRUNC);
    if (fd < 0)
    {
      MSG_HIGH ("rsf_open failed with error : %d", fd); //error handling
      return;
    }

    result = rfs_write ("/file1", buff, 100);
    if (result < 0)
    {
      MSG_HIGH ("rsf_write failed with error : %d", result); //error handling
      return;
    }

    offset = rfs_seek (fd, 0, RFS_SEEK_SET);
    if (offset != 0)
    {
      MSG_HIGH ("rfs_seek failed with error : %d", offset); //error handling
      return;
    }

    result = rfs_read ("/file1", buff, 100);
    if (result < 0)
    {
      MSG_HIGH ("rsf_read failed with error : %d", result); //error handling
      return;
    }

    result = rfs_close (fd);
    if (result != 0)
    {
      MSG_HIGH ("rsf_close failed with error : %d", result); //error handling
    }
