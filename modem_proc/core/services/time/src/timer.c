REGIONAL FUNCTIONS 

  timer_init()
    Initializes the timer subsytem.  Call only from time_init( ).


EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  timer_def(timer, group, tcb, sigs, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer.

  timer_def_priority(timer, group, tcb, sigs, func, data, timer_prio)
    Same as timer_def, but with an option to defnie the timer as a priority timer also.

  timer_def2(timer, group, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer, with the clock callback semantics.

  timer_def2_priority(timer, group, func, data, timer_prio)
    Same as timer_def2, but with an option to defnie the timer as a priority timer also.

  timer_def_osal(timer,group,sigs_obj,sigs,func,data)
    Defines and initializes a timer. Provision of using a signal object for notification.

  timer_def_osal_priority(timer,group,sigs_obj,sigs,func,data,timer_prio)
    Same as timer_def_osal(), with added option to specify the timer priority.

  timer_reg(timer,func,data,time_ms,reload_ms)
    Complimentary function to timer_def2. Sets the timer as per the passed params.
    
  timer_set(timer, ticks, reload, unit)
    Sets an inactive timer to expire after a given period of time, or changes
    an active timer to expire after a given period of time.
    Optionally, specifies the timer to repeatly expire with a given period.

  timer_set_64(timer, ticks, reload, unit)
    Same as timer_set, but this API also supports the 64 bit timetick values @ 19.2 Mhz as an input.

  timer_set_absolute(timer,time)
    Sets an inactive timer to expire at the given time, or changes an active timer to expire at that time.
  
  timer_get(timer, unit)
    Get number of ticks before timer expires

  timer_get_64(timer, unit)
    Same as timer_get(), but with support for 64 bit timetick values @ 19.2 Mhz.

  timer_get_params(timer,timer_attrib_struct_ptr)
    Fills up the passed timer attribute structure with timer parameters.

  timer_set_params(timer,to_set,timer_attrib_struct_ptr)
    Updates the timer parameter based on the passed arguments.

  timer_is_active(timer)
    Returns boolean TRUE / FALSE based on the timer active status.

  timer_expires_at_64(timer)
    Returns the 19.2 Mhz, 64 bit timetick val for the timer's expiry if it is active 

  timer_expires_at(timer)
    Returns the slow clock based timetick val for the timer's expiry if it is active

  timer_get_start_64(timer)
    Return the 19.2 Mhz based 64 bit timetick value when the timer was started.

  timer_get_start(timer)
    Return the slow clock based timetick value when the timer was started.

  timer_pause(timer)
    Suspends an active timer

  timer_resume(timer)
    Resumes a previously "paused" active timer.

  timer_clr(timer, unit)
    Stops an active timer and return the remaining slow clock based timeticks before expiry.

  timer_clr_64(timer, unit)
    Stops an active timer and return the remaining 19.2 Mhz based 64 bit timeticks before expiry.

  timer_stop(timer,unit,rem_time)
    Stops an active timer and returns the remaining ticks before expiry in the passed argument.

  timer_undef(timer)
    Stops an active timer and also deallocates any internal memory reserved for the timer.
      
  timer_clr_task_timers(tcb)
    Stops all active timers which belong to the specified task.

  timer_clr_osal_thread_timers(thread_id)
    Stops all active timers which belong to the specified thread.
   
  timer_group_enable(timer_group)
    Enables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group which expired during the
    diabled period will have their expiry processing executed.

  timer_group_disable(timer_group)
    Disables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group will continue to count
    down, but they will not expire.

  timer_group_set_deferrable(pgroup,condition)
    Sets the passed group property as deferrable or non-deferrable



INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

    timer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

    timer_def() must be called, or the TIMER_DEF( ) macro used, for each
      timer, before other timer functions are used with that timer.

    A valid sclk estimate is needed before timers can be set.

  *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE ***

  
  All comparisons in this module are done with respect to a moving origin,
  or "zero" point, to handle wrap-around of the 32-bit slow clock counter.
  
  For example, the conditional statement "if ( now >= expiry )" is wrong,
  since "now" could be 0xFFFFFF00, and "expiry" could be "0x00000100", ...
  "0x200" counts in the "future".
  
  The correct comparison would be "if ( now - zero >= expiry - zero )".
  This compares the current time (measured from some point in the past) to
  the expiry time (measured with respect to the same point in the past).
  If the "zero" origin was "0xFFFFFE00", with the above values, "now - zero"
  would be "0x100" and "expiry - zero" would be "0x300", making the entire
  expression FALSE; the expiry point has not been reached.

  If the expression "now - zero >= expiry - zero" returns TRUE, then it is
  safe to subtract "now - expiry" to determine how much time has passed since
  the expiry point.  If "now - zero >= expiry - zero" returns FALSE, the
  reverse subtraction is valid: "expiry - now" indicates how much time
  remains until the expiry point.
