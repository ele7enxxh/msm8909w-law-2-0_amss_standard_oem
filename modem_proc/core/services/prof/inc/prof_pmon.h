PACKET   BLAST Performance Monitoring information

ID       LOG_BLAST_PM_C

DESCRIPTION
  Contains performance information collected from QDSP6 for the requested
  events.

  ver:        Version no. to handle future changes. For this format
              ver = 1

  app:        Field to distinguish multiple BLAST systems on the same
              target.
              0 - Modem SW
              1 - Modem FW
              2 - Multi Media

  rsvd:       2 bytes reseved for future use.

  counters[x]: Performance information collected from QDSP6 corresponding to
              the requested events.

  total_samples: The total number of core cycles elapsed so far.

  total_sclk_samples: The total number of sleep clock ticks elapsed so far.
              Sleep clock runs at fixed frequency of 32768 Hz.

  idle_samples[x]: A measure of the HW thread time used for running tasks.
              This field is set to how many pcycles each HW thread was
              sleeping.

	
  flags:      Same as LOG_QURT_TASKPROFILE_C
