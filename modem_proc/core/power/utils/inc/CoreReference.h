Abstract Reference Tracked data type

This defines an abstract reference tracking structure.  Any entity
that wants to add reference tracking would "inherit" from the abstract
core reference and provide a constructor of sorts that sets up the
vtable, and adds whatever extra tracking data is required.

This implicitly assumes references will be stored in a list
