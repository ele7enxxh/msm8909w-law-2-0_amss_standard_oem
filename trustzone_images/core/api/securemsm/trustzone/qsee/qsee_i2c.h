 *   3. Lock the I2C bus for exclusive access \n
 *   4. Register for the I2C interrupt in TZBSP, thereby
 *      transfering the interrupt from the HLOS to TZ \n
 *   5. Disable the I2C interrupt since in TZ I2C is implemented with polling
 *      rather than being interrupt driven \n
 *   6. Protect the control block for device \n
 *   7. Protect the QUP block for the device \n
