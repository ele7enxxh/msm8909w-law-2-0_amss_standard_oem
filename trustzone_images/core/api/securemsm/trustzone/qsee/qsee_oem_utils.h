* If key_len value exceeds 32, qsee will only take first 32 bytes as the sfs kdf derivation key. 
*
* @details If *key is set to NULL, sfs secret key will be different depending on whether the JTAG_DISABLE eFuse is blown. 
* Before the fuse is blown, sfs kdf uses the dummy HW derived key as the kdf derivation key. 
* After the fuse is blown, sfs kdf uses the HW derived key as kdf derivation key. 
*
* If key is set by OEM, sfs kdf always uses OEM key as kdf derivation key to create sfs secret key, 
* and JTAG_DISABLE eFuse won't affect the sfs secret key value.

*  which are then encrypted and integrity-protected before being written to the underlying file system. 
*  This function let the OEM decide the segment size.
*  For example, OEM have 2000 bytes plain text to save to SFS. The default SFS segment size is 1024 byte,
*  so SFS creates 2 segments (1024 bytes, 976 bytes + 48 bytes padding) on HLOS file system.
*  If OEM change the segment size to 2048 bytes, SFS creates 1 segment (2000 bytes + 48 bytes padding) on 
*  HLOS file system.
* 
*  OEM should be very cautious to make the change of segment size.
*
*@return segment size 
*@side effect: After the segment size change, The SFS files saved with old segment are useless.
* Must clean up the old SFS files on HLOS file system manually.
