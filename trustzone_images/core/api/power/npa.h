  NPA client API 
  This is not the API for authoring nodes.

  The interface uses strings and opaque types.  This is done
  intentionally to minimize client dependencies on the implementation.
  The data structures and implementation can change radically without
  requiring recompilation of client code

   If the named resource does not exist or it exists but doesn't

   NULL can be passed as these arguments.  Note that the macro
   npa_create_sync_client can be used for this case.

/**
   @brief npa_create_async_client_dal - Creates an asynchronous client of
   a resource

   Create an asynchronous client of the given resource with the given
   work model.  Requests made via an asynchronous client will be
   processed asynchronously. The new client will not be created with an
   initial request.

   If the named resource does not exist or it exists but doesn't
   support the requested client_type, a NULL handle will be
   returned. Callers are expected to check for NULL handles.
   
   A client must never attempt to use a NULL handle to update a
   resource.

   The client_name must be < 64 characters in length.

   The client_name string is not copied.  Any string pointer passed to
   the framework must be immutable. It is hoped that future versions
   will relax this restriction.  

   If non-NULL, the DAL event will be triggered when the asynchronous
   request has completed.  If the DAL Event is a callback, it will be
   invoked with the following arguments (context, 0, client_handle,
   sizeof(client_handle) );

   Restrictions: 

   In general, the same client can not have multiple simultaneous
   requests issued.  It is the responsibility of the user to make sure
   the previous request has completed before issuing a new request via
   the same client.
   
   Due to current limitations in DALSYS, async client requests can not
   be issued while INTLOCK'd.

   It is hoped that both these restrictions will be removed in future
   versions.
