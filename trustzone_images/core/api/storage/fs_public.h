/**
 * @defgroup efs_errno Error handling
 * @ingroup efs
 * \n \n
 *
 * All of the EFS APIs have a specific return value that indicates an
 * error.  For functions returning an integer value, the value '-1' is used
 * to indicate an error, and a NULL pointer is used for functions that
 * return a pointer.  When this value is returned, the global variable
 * efs_errno will be set to a value giving more specific details as to the
 * reason for this error, To interpret this  efs_errno see fs_errno.h
 */

/**
 * @defgroup efs_pathnames Pathnames
 * @ingroup efs
 *
 * EFS2 pathnames consist of null terminated strings of UTF-8 encoded
 * character data.  Directories are separated using the forward slash
 * character '/'.  Please note that EFS2 does not check the pathnames for
 * UTF-8 validity, a name component is simply terminated when a '/' or null
 * is encountered.
 *
 * Absolute pathnames begin with a slash, and relative pathnames omit the
 * initial slash.  (Since the current implementation does not allow the
 * 'current' directory to be changed, these resolve the same).  There are
 * two special names: "." which refers to the current directory, and ".."
 * which refers to the parent directory.
 *
 * An individual name component of a path (between slashes) can be no more
 * than FS_NAME_MAX characters in length.  An entire path is limited
 * FS_PATH_MAX characters.
 */


/**
 * @defgroup efs_hfat HFAT
 *
 * EFS2 supports removable media (MMC/SD, USB Mass storage) through the
 * notion of a hotplug manager.  This task keeps track of devices in the
 * system, and performs auto mounting and unmounting of the appropriate
 *
 * The removable media while available will be mounted as /mmc1, /mmc2 etc.
 * All of the EFS APIs can be called for these paths as well.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup hfat_pathnames HFAT Pathnames.
 * @ingroup efs_hfat
 *
 * HFAT pathnames and their length restrictions are driven by the FAT
 * filesystem. At the EFS API level all the filepaths are in UTF-8, but inside
 * the FAT filesystem all paths are stored in either SFN (Short File Name) or
 * LFN (Long File Name). The SFN are in MSDOS 8.3 format (8 characters for
 * filename, 3 characters for extension) and the LFN. Please consult the FAT
 * spec for more information on the SFN and LFN.
 *
 * Please see the \link unicode_pathnames \endlink section for actual size
 * limits.
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup efs_unicode Unicode
 *
 * All the EFS APIs take the filepath in UTF-8 format.
 *
 * In the EFS filesystem the filepath gets stored internally in the UTF-8
 * format itself, Whereas in the FAT filesystem the unicode filepath is
 * internally stored in the UTF-16 format as required by the FAT filesystem.
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup unicode_pathnames Unicode Pathnames.
 * @ingroup efs_unicode
 *
 * For the EFS filesystem the path lengths remains the same as explained in the
 * \link efs_pathnames \endlink section.
 *
 * For HFAT the max pathname length is 510 bytes including the terminating
 * NULL character. More specifically 255 2-byte unicode words plus 2-bytes for
 * the NULL.
 *
 * As per the FAT spec the max pathname length is 520 bytes, but we have chosen
 * 510 bytes to be compatible with OS like WinXP.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup unicode_hfat User specific UTF conversions.
 * @ingroup efs_unicode
 *
 * Users who want to have their own specific UTF conversions can do so by
 * changing fs_unicode_utf8.c, By default this file will have UTF-8 to UTF-16
 * conversions and use OEM code page 437 to generate short-file-name.
 *
 * Users can replace the following functions to have their own specific UTF
 * coding:\n
 * ::utf8_to_utf16 \n
 * ::utf8_from_utf16 \n
 * ::utf16_to_shortname \n
 * ::utf16_from_shortname \n
 *
 * Users can also replace the OEM code page 437 to their preferred code page
 * for Short-File-Names by replacing the array ::OEM_code_page
 */

 /**
  * @b fs_fresh_start
  *
  *
  * Using a debugger like JTAG, and setting this variable to a non-zero value

  *
  * To do this from jtag, set a breakpoint at the start of efs_initialize(),
  * then set fs_fresh_start to a non-zero value, and continue.

 *  be an approximation of the space reserved. So it is a wise idea to

 * Please NOTE :
 * This API will lock the filesystem and locking the filesystem can have
 * system wide impact as it will block some time sensitive EFS clients for the
 * locked duration. So the usage of this API has to be carefully studied on
 * a scenario by scenario basis. Please don't use this API if you are not sure
 * or if a system wide study has not been done for your scenario.
 *
 * @par Name:
 *  efs_lock_filesystem - Lock the access to the filesystem.
 *
 * @par Synopsis:
 *  @code
 *    #include "fs_public.h"
 *    int efs_lock_filesystem (const char *path);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * @par Description:
 *  Lock the file system. This API will block all future EFS clients from
 *  accessing the filesystem until the filesystem gets unlocked by the
 *  efs_unlock_filesystem API.
 *
 *  The lock/unlock APIs must be called by the same task; i.e., the task that
 *  calls the efs_lock_filesystem API must be the same task that calls
 *  efs_unlock_filesystem API as well.
 *
 *  When the filesystem gets unlocked, the task with the highest scheduling
 *  priority of all the waiting tasks gets unblocked first and will be the
 *  first one to get the EFS services.
 *
 *  When using the API please be sure to:
 *    - Not keep the filesystem locked for more than 1 second.
 *    - Unlock the filesystem using the same task that locked it.
 *
 *  When using the API it is recommendated to:
 *    - Put the phone in offline mode (Airplane mode). This reduces the number
 *        of active EFS clients.
 *
 * @param path
 *    Which filesytem to lock. Currently meant only for "/".
 *
 * @return
 *    Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure. Upon failure the efs_errno
 *    will be set to the exact fail reason.
 *
 * @par Errors:
 *   ::EINVAL - Invalid argument.\n
 *   ::EPERM  - The file system does not allow locking.\n
